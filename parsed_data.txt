you must have them shown visibly at all times
theres no such thing as concealed/open carry in vt remember
not if concealed
switchg blades are legal in vt anyway
Vermont is funny about butterfly knives because they say it's legal in one ruling but then put them under switch blades in another
since a saw is not a knife it does not apply

WHY IS TEAR GAS EXPLICITLY MENTIONED IN THE HANDBOOK

^

its not in the handbook because its rarely an issue
tools are allowed
I want to see where in the handbook that is stated
like dont argue with cps obviously but youve always been allowed saws\
Not according  to them
cps doesnt know what theyre talking about youre allowed to have a saw?
Cps said for him to get rid of saw
technically one isn't federal
not great but nt worth shitting yourself over
well
those are okay

idk autodesk just wants to bathe in money
Bro why is this so complicated
https://tenor.com/view/itrendz-itrendz-trading-itrendz-family-options-trading-money-gif-26396247
Autodesk:
So, to "simplify", in order to use products in the Autodesk Flex system, the user has to buy at least the minimum amount of tokens at an Autodesk defined rate (100 tokens) that last for a set amount of time at an Autodesk defined rate (1 year lifespan per token) with the per token price set at an Autodesk defined rate ($3.00 per token) to spend on a temporary time period of access for a product at an Autodesk defined rate (24 hours per token cost), in which, the number of tokens to activate a product is‚Äîto no one's surprise‚Äîset at an Autodesk defined rate (1 token per day for Mudbox, 1 token per day for Maya Creative, 6 tokens per day for 3ds Max, and 6 tokens per day for Maya, etc. etc.)

Bringing this all back to Maya LT's death, with that software, you could have 1 year of access for $300, or about ~$0.82 per day. For it's new equivalent, Maya Creative, at current rate, is effectively $3.00 per day which a 365% price increase over Maya LT. That is especially clear with 365 tokens costing $1095 per year.

thankfully, there is Maya Indie which is a full version of Maya for eligible users priced at $290 per seat. Given how shitty Autodesk is, who knows how long this will be available for though. https://makeanything.autodesk.com/maya-indie-usa#elegible -- for better or for worse, Maya is the industry standard and for those who want to hone their craft in Maya/want Maya proficiency on their resume I'd recommend getting your license sooner rather than later.
So Maya LT is dead, and is primarily being replaced by Autodesk Flex.

this new system is where the user/company buys tokens that are dished out to users. When a user opens a product, the account that is tied to it is charged a set number of tokens based on each individual product's rate. The user has a 24 hour license to use the program from the moment to open. The user can open and close the software as much as they want but post 24 hours, they will have to pay the new token fare. Each token is, at the current rate, $3.00 and the cheapest option to buy tokens is 100 for $300.
No what happened
<@425781751516889118> did you see what autodesk did the Maya licensing?
No more typing for me I guess

wtf is going on (the highlighted section is hidden somehow)

I spend a lot more time with brass and copper which are a little more inert so not super familiar with it what I used to melt s*** in a handmade foundry in the garage
Yeah it's more up the metallurgy alley than the science teacher alley to be honest that's at least that's what I would think
you have no idea how many science teachers i harassed about this lol
with more words
wasnt that literally my theory
Aluminum has a very low reduction potential. Much lower than steel, which the pan is almost certainly made from. You are basically making a battery with the two metals.

The steel (or one of the other metals in the pan) is getting oxidized by the food. These ions then steal the available electrons off of an aluminum atom, oxidizing the aluminum. The oxidized aluminum turns into aluminum oxide, probably, which is brittle and separates from the foil. Keep going with this and you end up with a hole.
fair
it's from radiation
What does this email I just got mean
Like some reaction of potassium and iron? Idk
What kind of acid tho

No shade to these RAs but a lot of ras are dumb
Hmm
But apparently,  according to my RA, lizards are not recognized in nc as esas
https://www.ncdhhs.gov/divisions/vocational-rehabilitation-services/independent-living-people-disabilities/service-animals-people-disabilities
You have to get paperwork done through your doctor,  then something,  then through the school. One of my roommates did it with her cat
At cc and elsewhere you just need a note from your dr saying the animal helps your mental health
Oh hmm
You have to in order to keep them at school
How?
Because they‚Äôre not regulated or protected under ada
Yeah you can register them here
Maybe nc is different but I‚Äôve always been told it‚Äôs not possible to register an emotional support animal at all
Our ras are taught that in training
Nope
Because that‚Äôs the Ada list of service animals
I think perhaps you‚Äôre thinking of service animals
no
Did you know that lizards cannot be registered as emotional support animals in NC? Only cats, dogs, mini horses, and on special circumstances rabbits?
is mine bad?
I have seen so many different ways to do that table

These component prices are too DAMN high
lets be real here
thats whats has to change
im not shitting on right to repair
Companies will still charge the same
soo there is a argument both ways
even cheaper
and with lower power use
but when you can combine its more cost savings
mobos do
but cpu's dont die
it already has been lmao
and more reliable tbh
Right to repair is gonna get rekt
more efficent and faster
why
Makes me kinda sad
becuase of custom hardware like ASIC
my bad
hand builts will be pointless to gamers though
Less people will probably learn to build PCs
Barrier to entry will be greater
Yeah, but pc builders aren't just gonna invest in enterprise hardware just because it's more modular
not in enterprise
debatable
robots will do it
I'm worried that socketed CPUs will go extinct
well yeah
they from good will in ny lol
nah
im worried the pc building bis will shrink

One scenario that would be independent of the environment is a habit. Like picking your nails regardless of the environment.
It's hard to think of a scenario in which one would act independently of the environment because we almost always behave due to what's around us
how/why would someone react independently from the enviornment
are you dependent on the enviorment to react or do you react independently from the enviornment
What is the question?
did yall know sometimes people make choices not based on the things around them? im lost i hate this chapter

i odnt think i would use it
idk i have one and i dont use it alot but my handwriting is also ass
I personally would do the stylus
ill get the 10$ one hehe

hmm
because of cyber monday
i can basically have a second phone for free
are you looking to get a new phone?

the 5g stylus is arguably better
same

I have no idea what firewall port would do that
But not send
And I can receive discord messages
Soo I'm confused
And ns lookup.works
And redirects to the cloud flair page
1.1.1.1 resolves via the web app
Soo it has to be a client side setting
And I did not have this issue using the same profile on my phone
It's very werid
(I'm on my phone)
And neither do discord messages
But web results don't resolve
Yeah like I'm currently on my proxmox web gui
https://tenor.com/view/mario-dance-party-toilet-meme-gif-17347039

Hmm
But I cannot use DNS
And external systems via IP
O the local systems
I can connect
Yes
Do you have it port forwarded?
ive tried changing the DNS servers here to no avail
thats my wireguard config

Paul‚Äôs finally awake idk what he wants hang on
i come if want
i still need to go to the mall tho lol
paul was supposed to start work at 9. idk if hes still working today
thats not a bad idea
might go to gym a day early ig
got an event at 7
didnt take as long at i thought
i did it
i thought you had school stfff to dp
me too
im bored
Maybe Paul hacked u
i lied
well discord works
lol
That‚Äôs the only thought I have but I will wake Paul up at 12 as is our agreement
Used to. I used to have that problem. To clarify
Idk all I know is like when I try to connect my computer to external stuff it doesn‚Äôt work because of security settings I didn‚Äôt know I had
ive never seen it just block all DNS traffic
like local firewall issue?
But obviously I know nothing so disregard
Which to me sounds like a firewall issue if it‚Äôs not happening on phone
like i can go to 1.1.1.1 and get cloudflairs website, but if i look up cloudflair it dosent resolve
but outgoing internet dosent work
i can connect to my local addresses
well i dont have connection issues
Idk enough about Linux but 99% of my connection issues to servers have been firewall related
no linux
but DNS No Bueno
Are you on windows?
like i can manually enter IP's and they work
but have no issue issue on my phone
for some reason i cant resolve any DNS requests while im conencted to mine on my laptop
hmm
He says he‚Äôs he used it for his whole network
He fell asleep again hang on
ask him if hes usign a vpn to access his proxmox
lol
He says ‚Äúok‚Äù
about vpn server stuff
i just have a question for him üòÑ
He can be what do you need
I have a quick Q for him
is paul awake yet?
i think we have overshot restorative stuff in public schools
and i really truthfully mean that, im not being dramatic
i dont want to imply im against crt or anything like that but i have had a hard time in my district recently because it's frustrating to see my students not be given the same services because they are white

Nah you‚Äôre good. I read it the same way at first and everyone else thought the same thing
I fucked up
Yeah I realized that
I‚Äôm rereading the text from compass and that‚Äôs for a different event entirely
‚ÄúHey Lisa, I hope you are having a good semester. I just wanted to talk to you about the programming for trans day of remembrance, because myself and others find some parts of it a bit concerning. I am so glad the programming is happening and will/did attend but I personally think offering a prize to bring the most people to a vigil is slightly insensitive. I feel like it‚Äôs taking away a bit of the impact, and could potentially trigger friends who are dragged to the event for the sake of the prize. ‚Äú
how?
There‚Äôs a way to say it nicely
i really want to say somehting to lisa about that bc i believe that it wildly disrespectful
yeah i think is absolute horse shit
It‚Äôs also fucked to offer a prize to bring the most people to a vigil
Nah you‚Äôre in the right
just feel like they mad now, probably is nothing
I don‚Äôt really think that‚Äôs drama
wont next time lol
kind of which i didt say anything
i did not mean to start drama
No that‚Äôs fair
wasnt trying to say it was a bad event i just dont want texts

half of that is just cache

like i think at 194 we spent like 25 a week maybe?
id be surprised if you spent more than that
In theory, without any meal plan, inorder to remain equal to a standard dorm and meal plan, I need to spend 110 or less on food per week
and in the rare times i was thye would just tell me i was stupid and doing everything wrong (my dad is autistic and me cutting an onion wrong would make him so angry)
i wasnt allowed to in hs either
youre cooking the food anyway you just need a tupperware
(Wasn't allowed to before)
Mind you I've been making food for myself since I graduated hs
That's what I was trying to tell my mom but she was like that's a lot of work
I would say meal plan doesn‚Äôt make sense unless you imagine going to Zime a lot. You could just bring leftovers
Ig the question is over the year would I buy 2614$ worth of food for myself if I had the diamond meal plan or not
I leave like 90% here
Not for like all my stuff
Can‚Äôt you use champ support
Yeah and I wouldn't have to get a storage unit

That's when it all went down hill

South Carolina is below us.  It's closer to wilmington

Virginia is right above right?
Carolina seems like a nice middle ground
But I feel the same with heat and power down there
And sometimes no cell if the towers are coated

Bc no power
Ice Stroms are more deadly tbh

But I choked on a few things
It was great
My verkada interviewer had never done an interview before
Lol

Couldn't see she was on a laptop and it was neck up almost
A little rough because it was her first time interviewing for the position
how do you think it went? and how formal was she dressed?
ok
Yeah it is

<@416404018634686465> I was the first person she interviewed for the position so there was confusion over if it was remote
Deliver cara shampoo lol but I mean there is other stuff to do
For what purpose
Does anyone need/want to go to st j this weekend
Ya can like a general discipline and be flexible with where you want to go and not be flaky
So one scam of adulthood is the idea that a career is straightforward and you can only have one goal

so they're doing it for other men 100%
the one thing i will never understand about gym bros is they say they are getting buff for women when women don't actually (generally) think thats attractive?
the gym bro community is def problematic
They all also like jordan peterson: (
the first rule about fight club is you may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm
fight club is very homoerotic
but this movie was definitely a precursor for Mr. Robot
bruh im trying to understand a part of the fitness sub culture, and they call clinge to  fight club and i just watched it and its really weird
yeah, i did it for awhile
I think I would really enjoy theatre
I enjoy it
role playing kind of sucks not gonna lie
Also I‚Äôm stealing someone else‚Äôs joke
Neurotypical people don‚Äôt usually enjoy the rigid rules and getting to role play army boy that rotc does

ROTC is recruitment for autistic people
Sleep they won‚Äôt notice

You can send an email stating that you feel the relationship is no longer necessary or therapeutic, then that is cause enough to stop going
Technically she doesn't have to stop in that case
Man here with his back to the waterfall taking pictures of cars. Irony
Good idea
She'll have to stop being your therapist
Tell her you're in love with her

why didn't I think of grep
FUCK ME
this what you want

bash scripting
what assignment
Oh and if I just echo the result of nslookup, it acts like an ls command at first for some reason
Also that == is supposed to be a !=
If it's a valid string, then stringN is the correct value, but I can't figure out what the value actually is when it fails
<@303228816631791627> <@416404018634686465> How do you check if nslookup returned a valid record in bash?  I've been beating my head against a wall for 2 hours and I'm so done with this problem. I store the result in a string, but A) the string isn't empty, B) when I try to print it out, it sometimes  prints *** server can't find <record name>: NXDOMAIN* but C) when I try to check for a star by taking a substring of the first character and using an if statement, it tells me this isn't valid syntax even though I plugged it into several checkers for syntax online and they all say it's fine.
The knew they were going to do it since July appearently but they needed approval from my fucking step sister

Last night some shitty SoHo residents kept threatening to break the pumpkin on Bankus' porch and actually got into the hall, stole our skeleton decoration (we decorated the walls and the skeleton belongs to one of the residents) and broke it.  It's now missing an arm, a leg, and was broken where the spine and pelvis met.  However, I can't get over how funny this is:

For those of you hardware monkeys out there, I'm looking into GBA assembly for a final project and found a guy with way too much time on his hands: https://www.youtube.com/c/ChibiAkumas/playlists
Alex is actually really cool.  I see him around campus all the time.  Last night, Grace (Bankus Co) had the engagement event at the grind for parents weekend and Alex sang a Mexican folk song on the guitar.
(Not my dental records )

wtf
AAAAH
im prolly going to move my c drive today

soo R1 sent to R2 when it had no other routing
for each other
i had to set the last resort gateway on both
fixed
can r2 ping r1?
its like the second router dosent know where the first is
the gateways are valid
check your default gateways then
do i have to do the default route on both
the packet just bounces between R2 and the server?
and getting lost on the return??
lmao
its making it to the second router
wait
reboot
yeah soo idk????
oh üëÄ
i started over 3 times lol
i tired that
i am too, i just did the commands in the lab and it worked? maybe save your file and then redownload the other and try again
im a bit confused
but i followed ip route command to a T
soo i can ping 30.0.0.1 but not 30.0.0.2
i can ping router 1 but not 2
on the routers
yeah
yeah thats what i did first
you mean make sure the interfaces are on?
yeah mine were turned off

I believe you audit it then it goes on your transcript as an audit
i 'audited' classes where they put me in schoology but i was never enrolled
Fair

If you do it through self service you dont
In self service select audit instead of graded
You have to get permission though from the prof
Mostly just show up
How do you audit a class
Don't worry about it; it's just making lemonade

Hello! I am Miles Campbell, a Champlain College student studying to be a digital forensics and cybersecurity professional. I have experience automating with Ansible, BASH, PowerShell, and Python. In addition I have experience imaging and conducting investigations with Encase, Axiom, and Autopsy. 

In my youth I really enjoyed Sherlock Holmes stories, and I have found joy in digital investigations. I have also found enjoyment in being apart of the team that supports Champlain College's cyber infrastructure, in addition to IT Help Desk. 

In my spare time, I work on personal tech projects, deveolping my own home lab, and read other stories of threat investigations; it is always thrilling to learn something new!
Looks fine. If reword the first sentence to say something besides ‚ÄúI‚Äôm‚Äù tho
about me section sucked
Why would you write on LinkedIn

i dont think i write in a good style for linkedin
I still get offers of tech jobs from my lab tech days because they see that somehow
Not in the sense that the job doesn‚Äôt exist but they don‚Äôt actually want you they send it to thousands of people
yeah its linkedin
Every dm on LinkedIn is a scam
Is this LinkedIn

how much do we want to bet this is a scam or a shitty position
when i touch my chest i feel it in my arm pit
Got in an argument with my boss because he said raccoons aren‚Äôt sentient
I just know I had a bad reaction to tetanus last time and terrible reactions to Covid
It‚Äôs okay. I‚Äôm just hoping I react okay overnight

L E M O N

It‚Äôs very hard to make yellow
But it doesn't match the style
etsy's logo is orange tho
Make etsy yellow
this is the front for context
how can i make this look better

i can probably do phd for under 20k as well
like i had a car loan and student loans and could also have a home loan. most people have student loans until they are 60+
yeah i mean you can have multiple loans tho
im going to need to do that for a house lol
you can take out loans as well that is what i am doing

i might do this after i turn around some cash
yeah im looking at it
https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees/cybersecurity-information-assurance-masters-program.html
wow
most of the time is is completely remote complete asynchronous
versus >60k at wpi
so how does it work, its all remote right? so is it just all asynchronous? or do you have like remote zoom calls or something?

im looking at WGU
what the name
You can get masters degrees for under 20k if you don‚Äôt care about the university name
yeah : (
Gotcha. Most jobs need a masters degree these days it‚Äôs very frustrating
unless a job like wants me and weve got those convos going
not sure but if so not for a couple of years
Do you plan to get your masters?
yeah
i guess i am biased towards the IT side because there is a lot of need, just not a lot of money
i mean there are jobs
honestly considering most of the work around md is government so id the first it what i should do
why
21620
whats your zip code in md
im hoping for 90k to 100k out of champ, thats what many of my digital forensics friends get at when they get out
But definitely >70
Money I‚Äôd go with the first, the other two there are thousands of jobs that make decent pay
i need a quick turn around on money but id like to do something i dont hate
both

What happened in north
Now I'm certain that assuming really does make an ass out of u and me
He thought I said south house or Jensen.  Then he went and check summit and schill as I called him back.  I just assumed something else came up.
Oof what happened
Then he was kind of pissed about the run-around and said he couldn't do anything about it which is fair, but Ian told me to call them
lmao

Do you want to birth your own children?
I‚Äôm just pretty sure they rotted away
I get it like every six months maybe but you can still have a period without overdoes
I haven't had a period in forever lmao
I am unconvinced that my ovaries are actually there anymore
Among other places
Yes
Did you know that you cam grow teeth on your ovaries?
Your child can come live with their uncles dillon and Sandi while they are loosing teethüòÇ
Sometimes I have panic attacks when I remember there‚Äôs teeth in my mouth. It‚Äôs not even funny I just go about my daily life with a severe phobia OF SOMETHING MOST PEOPLE HAVE üòÇ
I really hope so
I heard that it changes when it's your own child
I just don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to deal with it
I‚Äôm kidding
When my child gets to that stage they‚Äôre going to live with grandma
That‚Äôs awful
My baby brother just lost his first tooth!
I ran away screaming from a kid with a loose tooth within the last two year
I usually have a high pain tolerance but it hurts
Yeah they‚Äôre going to have to put me down
It hurts like a bitch ngl
I think I have a cavity and I‚Äôm worried im going to need full anesthesia (I hit a nurse once on accident when she touched my tooth wrong )
What‚Äôs that like

Getting off the meal plan. I told her you just moved to 194 but I think she's still going to try to contact
About what?
Unfortunately this is the same for every restaurant and fast food place ever. Bleh but
FYI Breezy is going to try to contact you <@408779745136738324>  but I didn't give contact info

There was a sign up but Debra grabbed it from me
No it‚Äôs because of rabies
It's probably to do with breeding seasons they do catch and release at Rowell to make sure the population is okay
They‚Äôve put traps around the apartment üò¢

?
He didn‚Äôt do anything
They‚Äôre trying to arrest my man big boy
Hmm they were on the lid that‚Äôs how I pulled that info
they don't list ingredients which is also sus
i have a giant bag of beeswax if you need
also the thing with the beard balms is you could easily recreate it using basic ingredients
i had success with coconut oil, its only a few dollars and worth a try if youre really looking for it
yeah, everyone says its a best thing besides monoxidil, which even if i only use topically, makes me feel like im dying
im looking at it tho and it has peppermint oil in it which seems like it would burn if you have acne or whatever
i have heard those things help with hair strength, nothing really helps with hair growth tho
this is very popular on Instagram and everyone swears by it but idk it seems like a scam https://www.drdhtbeardproducts.com/

bleh
yep
seems like i can give it 48 hours, if there is no money i file an unpaid item notice. then i can relist the item.
Yes is
mmm
that is not the same man
twas a scam
Year difference

for privacy
i belive soo
okay it looks like i dont get a full address until they pay? is that accurate
well you cant ship without an address lmao
hmmm
uh oh there is no address
ebay should be good about it if its a scam, and if they use paypal to pay, even better
i would accept the offer
mmm
ugly dress

just out of curiosity
whats the item?
you can also wait for payment confirmation before shipping
if its in the description, then your good in that department
yes
so i was very clear that the item is "as is"
i belive
but they have to pay before you ship
Hmm I would be careful, I know that ebay is very buyer orientated when it comes to disputes
and the account is like 3 weeks old. if i accept it and send them said item am i protected?

how safe is it as a seller? because someone just offered double asking price but they dont seem to have much account history
i sell on it a bit
yes
do you guys know anything about ebay?

I have approximate knowledge of many things
Duh
Oh yeah
lol now that i think about it rats in the wall is kind of similar to the raven
I haven‚Äôt read a lot of love craft but I think that‚Äôs more sexual/human nature than mental illness
do we consider lovecraft's stuff to be about that as well bc he was really  by poe
Robert?
There‚Äôs no raven that‚Äôs what the whole poem is about
Because it‚Äôs about mental illness
John frost poems are more naturey
why not?
No
do we consider the the raven by poe to be a nature poem?

I‚Äôm sad these guys missed the era of Champlain students pepper spraying each other for fun

I dont want to be pepper sprayed either but I carry that too
Yes but i don't plan on attacking anyone. If someone attacks me then I say they have what's coming to them
Bruce always told us that you should never carry anything you wouldn‚Äôt want to be used on you
Mines shaped and double purposes as a flashlight. It would take effort to zap myself
I know so many people zap themselves with it so I don‚Äôt want that
That‚Äôs fair

I guess I spend so much time in the sun that scars fade fast
idk mine are always different even when from the same source
it seems like 10 years is the amount of time it takes even minor scratches to disappear on my skin lol
yeah
and then it stays tan according to Richard (step dad[plastic sergoen])
and also scar tissue doesnt tan so the skin tans around it and makes them more obvious
yeah
0robably because the tissue is sensitive and you don't want cancer
ive got some keloiding so they want me to switch to strips instead of gel
Oh damn lol
thats  the 1 thing they told me not to do lmao
Mine tend to fade in sunlight
do those work for you they always made my scars worse

which idk about you but i havent worn a mask in a hot minute
also i think its 89% or whatever assuming you do all reccomended vaccines and wear a mask and whatever
Yeahhh
in theory yeah but they proved pretty quickly tht wasnt the case
Wasn't it originally supposed to be like if you got it you would hardly even know you had it and it wouldn't be contagious
doesnt stop you from getting it at all tho
its 89% effective in you not being killed
So much for the vaccine being 89% effective
unless you had j&j for #1 then 3
you should have 4 at this point
yes there has been for a while but were just now eligible
I already have one booster,  is there another?
damn cdc says i need a covid booster
I was just sucked to a parallel dimension

Yeah
Now that I understand how it works I can get it in under 20
Why the floor off? Is the carb in a weird place
But it looked like a pain
hahah
I bet I could do it faster

It's about an 1hr operation to get the floor off the ruckus
Desk floof
I'll peek I've got a bunch of methods
Some of today's findsüêö

Oh no
What ever tech did an inpection on the ruckus before it was put out on the line stripped the manifold screws
2 fucking screws stopped me pulling out the carb

Me when I‚Äôm bzzz

It‚Äôs been like that since before boys weekend
there is another

that would be illegal
soo like
but unfortunatly these condos are like hundreds of thousands of dollars and privatley owned
thats sus
mmmm
idk how some people don't realize
i mean there WERE random cameras inside
but i mean correlation is a thing the human mind does
thats a vibe
lol
Me unplugging everything I thought was a security camera at our Airbnb but it was wifi extenders
Rant over
Huh
Like hmmm wow the box on the wall does more then make green lights to keep me up
They are just so ignorant sometimes
Rich people errk me
Lmao
<@227204721809686528> I love when I get calls for no wifi in the villa condos, and it's because people unplug the wifi AP in the bedroom because the lights, and then they complain multiple times a day that the wifi is down
Both
Which one
Looks like a good place

But Mitch is a homie
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLtaCyiPnBI
Come hang out with me im bored
It's for the moped
Paulll
<@416998580071563264> You know when you get that feeling that today is a good day to tear apart your carburetor?
ripp üò¶
I‚Äôm bored Jericho is boring
yeah, it would probably have like a temperature strip on it that changes if not properly stored, if it can get you sick
I‚Äôm just going to hope for the best
Like even if it‚Äôs not dead what if it‚Äôs not safe
But also like obviously I‚Äôm not a virologist but I‚Äôm worried that live salmonella might hurt me if not properly contained?
spook
mmmm
I think my mother did
not much you can do, did yo sign the little release form?
i mean i guess just go with it, and see where that gets you
huh
I tried that they just said it was refrigerated and just warmed up fully to room temp in 5 minutes lol
but if your like I need this to be refrigerated for my personal health and you said it was and it wasn't refrigerated?... just a thought
And they were all on the cashiers side. I was very composed and explained the issue and they just told me I was wrong lol
No they were already rude about it
üò¶
well I would maybe go back to cvs and explain your issue? i don't know what their policy about it is?
jeezus
I‚Äôll know if I don‚Äôt get typhoid
D:
i see
Yes but I‚Äôd have to pay for it
if so you could tell your doctor, and they may be able to arrange something, like a fresh batch?
interesting, well will you know by a certain point if its not working?
oh?
Because it‚Äôs literally live salmonella virus lol
But if it‚Äôs bad I‚Äôm screwed
that's a tough one
I don‚Äôt know
yeah thats a great question, would have thought they would have just kept it in the fridge till pickup
Not really
I mean why would it not have been in the fridge period though
is there any way at all to know if its still good?
but if you thought you heard one say "oh shoot",
idk im not defending them, just questioning their experience
yeah i know but like you can have food out and not warm for a while
Yeah but in 5 minutes it wouldn‚Äôt have gone from cold to warm
that is very upsetting tho
but who knows how long is an acceptable non refrigerated period
i mean probably not?
Don‚Äôt you think a medication that just came out the fridge wouldn‚Äôt be‚Ä¶ warm?
that seems like a bad yelp reveiw
D:
I went to pick up a $100 prescription and the lady hands it to me (I don‚Äôt see her get it) but once I get to the car and open it I see that it says ‚Äúkeep refrigerated‚Äù the thing is warm with no condensation. I go back in and I speak to a different cashier and I swear I hear the first one say ‚Äúoh shoot‚Äù after we explain that it‚Äôs warm. But then they say they got it out of the fridge. And so now I can‚Äôt return it. And my $100 LIVE VIRUS medication is probably useless now
Squeaky floof
Can I just say fuck cvs
She‚Äôs protecting you
Good
I can't spell
He demons on the shadows cant hurt me if I don't acknowledge them
Nooo
Lol XD my cat just squeaks at me sometimes at night
There are two wolves inside of you

But I'm no phyc person
Id like to think that mental hospitals are just people who's Intrusive thoughts are winning
If I wanted to I could walk to a mental hospital, police academy or juvy. But that‚Äôs the only stuff by me
Are those everyone or just me

Lol
Oh there‚Äôs still a mental hospital nearby so they can lock me away
Lol ü§£

Spook

hes debatable
bill gates is okay

0oh
lol
daddy bill gates
?????
you have been banished to Daddy Gate's whime
rippp

D:
Not if my domain doesn‚Äôt exist
you can veiw and send your outlook emails in gmail
it would probobly be what you want
Also according to google my domain doesn‚Äôt exist
its just importing you outlook email into gmail
I‚Äôm guessing it means make it look like google

"Gmailify"
gmaail afiy?
lol
and why is gmail asking me to do it lol
wut
what is gmaify
lol
because im 99% sure any homewrok i have will require i consult the web
well i dont plan to do work offline
its basically bloat
i hate that app
or at least it did in 2014
mmmm
excpecially if you doing accounting (which you arent) but my end useres are
you know gd has a desktop app that lets you use its full features
full features while having no internet = word
yes and no
google>>>>>>
excel tho ü•µ
i literally dont know how to use word i havent touched it sijnce 7th grade
üò≠
and export them as .docx files
or you can use google drive
they are going to
if they ask me to use word im going to riot
rip
yep
yeah no
just try it
idk then
this is grad school
hmmm
its in iowa
most HS's in VT use both, I did IT for my HS
jus tlike login and put in your email, and it will tell you if the company is found
try putting your email into google
yeah thats hard to tell
@bvu.edu
@bh.edu
like @trappfamily.com
whats the ending of the address
put your email in google and see if you can login?
yeah but like how do i know if its google
they would issue it to you
but i administrate a resort with no google
how do i know
unless you dont have a gmail account for them
you probobly do
accually
probobly not
so does this mean that since my school is 100% microsoft that we dont have google sutites
its not consumer grade
office suite is about efficiency not pretty
windows 10 mail is the worst
its ugly
it has alot of functionality
but once you get used its pretty cool
this is probably how i would describe the worst email inbox
outlook is interesting'
lol
wait ive like literally never used outlook before what is this
wait so like how am i supposed to use g drive?
im dying its so stupid
why does every grad school use microsoft insteaf of google

I got an A on my first Scudder assignment???????????
i was trying to highlight the name of the city to look it up?
What in tarnation
i have never in my life seen this pop up
the cinnamon rolls i get dont really unroll
i dont unroll it
i think?
cut or rip
like spinning it or just ripping it
i do that with the prepackaged pecan twirls only without a fork
i like to eat the outside first then work my way in
with a fork
and eat it bite by bite
i unroll the cinnamon roll
i wasnt expecting that answer honestly
...what do you mean ?
thats a new one
i cut it into halves and then quarters then either eat it that size or go smaller depending on how big
yeah i mean same but how do you approach it
with a fork and knife
how do you guys eat cinnamon rolls
Yeah you could shut down discord to help a bit but you‚Äôll probably need to clear chrome cache and maybe it needs an update? <@303228816631791627> thoughts please

Click processes

That will tell you
Can you open task manager
yeah
ah okay thanks. i dont know what I could be doing that takes up so much ram; ive only got 10 tabs open
Is it windows?
So you‚Äôre maxing out your cpu I‚Äôm guessing
That‚Äôs not real terminology I was just trying to think of the best way to explain it
Like Paul can probably explain it better but as far as I understand it there‚Äôs flexible memory (ram) used to run programs and stiff memory (hard drives, ssd, etc)
I‚Äôm assuming it means memory as In ram not space
tech people: my computer's search engine is running slow or not at all and it says memory is full but it shouldn't be because i have almost a terabyte of memory left on my D drive. how do I fix it
Oooh

Little buddy here finally got the fly that's been irritating the shit out of me. Earning their keepüëç
We‚Äôll see what AOE says
I don‚Äôt understand how I‚Äôd take and exam before getting the degree tho
I‚Äôm trying to study for an exam lol
I don‚Äôt either
I do not understand
It‚Äôs unclear
Yeah I‚Äôm wondering it‚Äôs referring to diagnosis stuff between genders like autism
Fun fact about psychology: There are more differences within the genders(such as between  girls) than between genders(such as boys and girls)
unclear if this is differences between the genders or transphobic

Too many bones
Trisha finally had her baby
Also they let Alex play Rocket League for the first time.  The other person just sat there pretty much.  10/10
Honestly agree.  Its nice that at least they're keeping to spaces open to people besides esports though.  Also, they're sponsored by a local pizza place so not all of it comes from the school
And then the heats broken the other half the year so the rooms never get below 90
Like they'd have to run them for a month or two max
Not to shit on game majors but champlain rlly do be spending so much money on esports but refuses to get one or two AC units for unairconditioned first year halls when they're old and hot enough to make people sick
Well thats just dumb.  Why put a security camera right on top of another one?  Waste of resources if you ask me.

And then another student told the whole library how her|| pussy tastes sweet and tangy|| and I‚Äôm like dude really

there is a new nepali restaurant on church st we should go
i dont know it well but its in williston and id never drive that far for chinese
oh yeah that's not one of my go tos
Asian bistro
Where did you get it
My stomach is not liking the Asian I got last night
im just confused
yuhhh
if theres a period when theres no students i can even run to dunkin
like im sitting and chilling all day, i can use the bathroom whenever i need
if it were 8 hours id say sure i probably need a break but a school is a much more relaxed enviorment than retail
well then make sure they know your working on it
hmmmm
they're required to pay for my whole lunch break if i work for even a minute of it so idk
thats a sticky situation
but also i work in the homework center after school so i wouldnt leave anyway
yeah
you do school stuff tho
lol not really an option when you teach
then dont take your break and leave early? XD
my contract says i get one, but not that i have to take one
yeah vermont law doesnt say i need a break
bruh -_- thats how trapps works, but they make you stay till 4:30 not 4, and i have to get an approval from the accounting manager to skip by lunch
so you think, okay, tack another half hour on at the beginning or end? that's not possible. so my max hours are really 28.75?
i work a max of 31.5 hours a week, divided evenly is 6.3 hours. i work 9 am to 3:15 (3:18 if you are being specific) but finance just emailed me and told me that is actually only 5.75 hours becuase im supposed to take a lunch break
rippp
work is being annoying
i know im just sayinf thats why you were tired
I had business to get done
F
i woke up to pee at 3 and he was still up

Last year it was may 25- June 7 so 1.5 weeks
lol okay
I‚Äôll personally give you 50$ if I‚Äôm capable tho
I‚Äôm not going to create false promises so assume volunteer but there could be money involved depending on how funding balances out
also is it all volunteer, or could we get paid?
Closer to grad, I'll probably have a good idea as to whether I'm staying or not, so consider me interested for now, but things could change
And it would get students interested in tech and Champlain
It‚Äôs through the high school and it would be super cool. I just need to email Allen or whatever back tomorrow and if I have interest I can go forward. Paul‚Äôs on the fence
Indoctrinate the children of tomorrow
oh wow that would actually be kinda cool
He‚Äôs not allowed to say any racial slurs tho we already talked about it
Hmm well if you‚Äôd stY until the first week of June you can help Paul teach a class to high schoolers about computer stuff

I also have to stop myself from doing students work for them like I had a specific way of doing work in high school and these guys aren‚Äôt üòÇ
Yeah I gotchu
Yes and 99% of the time it‚Äôs great but this neurodivergent is perpendicular to mine if that makes sense
You work with neurodivergent kids right?
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù that‚Äôs too open ended
What about open ended questions? Like what did she learn?
Im working with someone else now im not texting in front of her
I‚Äôve tried everything
Mmmmm maybe asking her differently?
But how do I get her to think critically about the writing? That‚Äôs rhetorical because it‚Äôs not within the ability
Hey if it works it works
I just don‚Äôt understand
And when she highlighted ‚Äúwinter solstice 1716‚Äù in her article I asked her why and she said ‚Äúit reminds me of dates, like January 1st is New Years‚Äù
She is but
She right tho
Yeah when I said what happened when it hit 10 Mach, and she said the number changes
Plane go faster than 9
i dont think i understand but im sorry
So we‚Äôre watching top gun for an assignment and the plan needs to reach 10 Mach and I ask her what happens when the plan reaches 10 Mach and she says ‚Äúwe‚Äôll it‚Äôs 9 then it‚Äôs like 9.1 then it says 10 and the number counts‚Äù like she‚Äôs answering my questions in an extremely literal way but like perpendicular to my literal thinking so I don‚Äôt understand
what is happening?

I mean the whole point of this was to decrease my resting hr which is it
im not going to try tho sounds boring
a mile isnt as long as i used to think
yknow i havent done cross country in a while but if its flat i think i could do that
Means your average speed is 10 mph
Its like a running accomplishment to be able to run a mile in 6 min or under
idk i think maybe normal if we are hiking(ish) and whatnot this weekend
just one mile?
No I go for the 6 min mile or do normal running today
Except the one in the back. Unplug thay one from the wall or whatever
Unplug them all,  twist them up and knot them, and then plug them back in different slots
All of them
Okay which things should I unplug to ruin the day
you can doordash it probabl
I dont think I have any
sinus rinse is also a godsend if you can stand it
but since i was in bed all day i didnt really care
yeah when i was sick paul made me help him install window cling and i almost passed out
So far without them I've almost blacked out three times. Obviously I don't want to overdo pills because it's easy to abuse meds but I do think they're helping right now at least
The meds always make me feel worse than the sickness
Your call obv but
Yeah if I were you I‚Äôd suggest cutting back. Like not fully but maybe skip a dose midday so you can do morning and night
More than like a glass of soda gives me bad anxiety
It doesn't say it does on the box
im on google and it says no but
Wait lemme check
that was why i wasnt allowed to have it as a kid lol
oh damn dayquil doesnt have caffine anymore?
I dont drink caffine

people abuse cough medicine for funzies, especially dayquil/nyquil/benedryl
not to be rude but thats probably part of why you feel bad, you're probably intoxicated

yeah fuck

Anything with qq.com shouldn't be there from how it reads
its all .exe
i didnt know those existed üëÄ the domain is not in the results?
If not I can go over it with you later because I think you're not supposed to have the qq domain in the results
Just find an online calculator
i dont feel like i have a good enough grasp on regex to do that
Yeah sort out the qq.com with regex in the proxy_close

"Most"
most of the time its right though
yeah but now i cant index it right all the time
I just did it in the .py
I was trying to sort out the qq domain
very sad
Yeah you can't do real regex in the yaml file I had that issue
how i have this 

```yaml
---
proxy:
  opened: '.*QQ.*\.exe.*open through proxy.*'
  closed: '.*QQ.*\.exe.*close.*'
```
it didn't like closed
```yaml
proxy:
  opened: '.*QQ.*\.exe.*open through proxy.*'
  closed: '.*(QQ.*\.exe).*close[^d].*(\d+ bytes .*?sent).*(\d+ bytes .*?received).*'
```
How did you have it setup?
<@416998580071563264> it was the way i did my yaml file
then its a list error
nah
Just force it?
Use convert?
not a list
but its thinking its a tuple
it has entries
its very odd
we did

Riot
It's been over a week and physical plant finally fixed the washer but the dryer still doesn't work.  My last load of laundry finally air dried and smells musty because it took two days.  I'm about to riot.

<@408779745136738324> just to confirm brunch is not happening tomorrow?
So hungry
Fair
I just went back to lakeside

Just looked at the map <@416404018634686465>
South house should be free

PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT: <@416404018634686465> Is a super awesome dude

Fuck pine Street is closed
Nope. It‚Äôs all pay by plate
Wait so I can't park at 371 either?
Yes
You couldn‚Äôt before but there‚Äôs no weekend parking period now
No
We can park at Rowell annex over the weekend right? <@408779745136738324> <@303228816631791627>
That makes sense
Ah I see
What pisses me off is it was a pet friendly restaurant since it had outdoor seating but like she had to be like that
oh how interesting

https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/service_animal_qa.html
From ada.gov

Ah
Yeah. If it‚Äôs a service dog it performs tasks but if it‚Äôs ‚Äúregistered‚Äù 99% of the time it‚Äôs just an esa someone is claiming is a service animal
so like same with dogs for the seeing impaired?
Ah gotcha
The ada doesn‚Äôt recognize any sort of service dog Registration
Yeah it‚Äôs not real
I dont know much about service dogs tbh
https://usaservicedogregistration.com/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw6_CYBhDjARIsABnuSzrx1evViBS8aaZLp-LvUbwYCtlKMQu3ztpBI6gsDwMfr_uAAipphEoaAjGxEALw_wcB
This?
(There‚Äôs no such thing as a service dog registry)
It was this
The tag hanging off of it that claims it‚Äôs a registered service dog with the government lmao
How can you tell
Fake service dog alert

huh

Indeed, red flag wa wa
Mmmm
Spicy wa wa
Angry ocean
bruh i still cant get my packet tracer to do what I want it to do
Oh nice
i got a brand new 500gb WD black 2.5" that was getting tossed you can have

Drink and eat candy corn
i forgots what happens
like bbq style? i havent been out on halloween since i stopped trick or treating at like 12
Let‚Äôs put a pin in it then? We could do the 28th too
Eyes probably
i cant tell if my monitor is going bad or my eyes are blurry
we might all be doing events tho
Do we not want to do a Halloween party it‚Äôs cool lol
Gayns
guys what should my blog be title
ig
Halloween party 10/29?
I hear him scratching around in the trash
The silly little guy is here
All we were told is that we don't have to worry about it so it's probably not a medical emergency.  If it is medical, he's probably fine now because I would hope they wouldn't lie to us like that
I've also been told that extra compensation is basically not on the menu.  I mentioned possibly guaranteeing that I'll be rehired next year without an interview though and Juliana was open to the idea.  I haven't pushed on anything yet.
I now have a blank check I can cash if I'm in a bind though.  "Sorry, I'm just really stressed from working with North House and Bankus.  It's been a lot"
Its a trick she is trying to get you to touch grass
Please go outside and look
Guys wtf is going on with the sun
Its in 015 now btw
You'll have to whipe it
Then see what Paul has
I could take the 128 now just to mess with it this weekend
: )
Ye
Are you still coming to my event
I would prefer sooner but I can wait. JJ let me take one of the old dell latitude laptops and I want to make it into a hackintosh. I know its compatible
No lol 128gb
How soon do you need it
I can look in a little
Or larger?
Any around 500 gigs?
They might be from 2011 but they work
What's the largest either of you have?
Yes too many
I think so
Yo does anyone have a 2.5 inch hard drive or SSD that they don't need?
Loaf
No you don‚Äôt Paul almost just exploded my car
I wish I was up there with you guys
You can but it's a bad idea
Did you know you can put gas in a car when it‚Äôs on
I agree 100% they are taking advantage of how good of a person he is
this is the 2nd most serotonin ive had this week
progress
finally

Is fay okay lol
Facts
You could probably beg for compensation
Dillon they really need to pay u more
Mmmm yay.  I have to reschedule an event I proposed a week ago that hasn't been approved because Roompact still thinks Juliana is my boss so paperwork is delayed.  Plus Fay is missing in action for reasons we have not been told so he hasn't seen it anyways.  We were only told that we don't need to be worried for him.
thinks its just fluid that will reabsorbe
surgeon was not concered
Ye
Fake news
The Trisha having her baby
Fake news
Trisha havint fake new
Yeah
Was that English Charlotte
Damn guys bad news the Trisha havint her baby was fake new
Mans came back from the 4th dimension

like how long can you go before its not fixable
whats the time frame on it
Its res which is more a seroma
just do it yourself
If it's a seroma I gotta get it out
It very well could be scar tissue or is a seroma
I'm not sure if it is actually anything
how bad is it like could cc health center help
calling did not work
i do think the 18 year old drinking age can be helpful, but also smoking addictions are awful in europe
id be fine with either
i do think the drinking age should be 18 or you shouldn't be allowed to join the army until 21
i can try, they usually shuffle us to the patient gateway but its worth a shot
maybe uvm med center can help with the issue
could you call?
hmmmm
surgeon wont get back to me : (
im not ready for that
im ready to bulk
im ready to age
then i look in the mirror and am like 'damn i actually am a child'
same
sometimes i feel like im 50
sunny side up with sausage
üëÄ
you can probably come if i ask susan
im going to
get noahs ark
were doing skinny pancake in the am and thats all i know
id like to but i am unsure of susans scheudle
art hop tomorrow at 10-2pm?
increased concern about taxes
hmm
lightbulb moments i guess
like just waking up at 2 am thinking 'oh so thats why eggs are a thing'
and also like random brainblasts
wack
itchy
my aunt also got married at 18 fun fact
what does that feel like lol
i will say though i can feel my prefrontal cortex finishing cooking and its disturbing. so there is a lot of development 18-25 but there is a lot of development 25+
yeah like people have to experience things and actually get out and make mistakes.
once you're 18 do what you want with marriage, but you will learn more the rest of your life. that doesn't stop at 25
when she marrid the prince
i mean me to be that doesn't mean you should be in a box until you are 25
like she was 18 when what
whats up with diana?
i will say i personally feel like i have developed a shit ton since i was 18. I was stupid
i just really hate this modern movent that 18 yos cant choose for themselves
yeah people are just talking about princess diane and like how she was 18 and stuff
the age of consent is 16 though so idk
transitioning yes, i think unfortunately the being with someone older you and tess are the exception and not the rule. and i mean that in the msot loving way but you are the only person i knoe in a relationship with an age gap that isn't toxic
for examples transitioning, being with someone older, etc
idk what youre talking about tho
because like drugs and stuff are very bad for brain development
^
whats the something
hot take the argument that you shouldnt do something cus your brain isnt fully developed is fucking stupid
dang
I think it‚Äôs like politicians voting not us
I think you technically could because of the apartment but idk if voting matters
i dont think i could vote on that bc im not a permanent resident
breh
All of the license plates in vt are made by prisoners
thats wild
At some point
does she want to come
Who will work for the dmv now
Uhhhh
Susan will be here
@here do you want to go to art hop toinight
uhm what the mcfuck
osha training time
because they cant allow investigators access to secure documents
damn i know it happened right before the queen died but i cant believe doj appealed the ruling where they could search the mar a largo documents for criminal case
add drop should not have ended
maybe you can switch ou
yeah
is he cor prof?
waiting on my doc to tell me to go to the fucking er so i dont need to be here
mmm now we've got to the anti aborntion rederic
it should be illegal to do on a minor
circumcision causes trauma even if you get it done as a baby
yeah im disagreeing with buckley
no like he is saying that a kid whos just had his dick cut off is not traumtized
i was gonna say hard disagree
oh okay
^ what he just said about a situation where the kid is 11 and its gone wrong
ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
curcumsion does not cause trauma
"I was hit as a child and I turned out fine" people who 'turned out fine' dont think about beating kids
who is this buckley guy and how does he still have a job
gentle parenting teaches logical consequence. like if you break a cup, hitting you doesn't teach you not to break a cup, it teaches you if you break/make a mistake a cup you get hit. if you break a cup and i make you clean it up, that is a reasonable consequence to your action
thats my argument
you don't. it's not congnitively appropriate. but they are also not going to be able to understand why their parent is hitting them. if they're too young to be reasoned with they're too young to understand the reason they're being hit
tell buckley you're sorry his parents hit him
"how do you reason with a 2 year old"
'kids these days don't know how to behave you have to knock some sense into them' or something?
he is arguing for hitting kids
that might not go over well with how crazy buckley is
he is arguing with me about parent rights and hitting kids
debating telling buckley i have children
from what I just read it doesn't the queen but the active monarch
it's who ever is in power
The queen legally owned every swawn in uk
what
Wait who do the swans belong to now
Okay let us know
Hmm I will see what they say, im convinced it is one but it might be scar tissue
But there‚Äôs also buses from Logan
Paul‚Äôs asleep rn but I‚Äôm sure we could come get you
Last time I had one I was able to drive and stuff after but more healed now so it will be harder
But how would I get back?
Since she‚Äôs going
Gotcha. Could Susan bring you down Sunday?
They will probably want me to come Monday
Possible seroma on my left
Why
Surprise trip to Boston anyone?
Just uh. Guessing

because they sure as hell don't get any funding from taxes lol
<@618173952904134676> why are tickets so expensive in NH smh

The DM rolled this. Wish us luck
Okay good
?
Goin a bit fast there

If so that's normal
Is the method not doing used?
Umm
hmm
That might be an issue
Oh
i uninstalled 3.9 and didn't select 3.10
oops
Interesting
python.org
no
From the windows store?
only 3.10 installed
So 1 had yaml and 1 didn't
I had a problem with having 2 different versions of python
As well make sure your using the same python.exe where pip was
Restart vs and see if that changes it
ok its installed
Redhat makes a vs package for yaml
In vs
this is windows
what
Install the redhat yaml package

And it's not working?

üëç I just killed the process in task and it worked
i did but i guess ill restart the whole machine too brb
Restart vs once installed
when i did that it sucessfully installed pyyaml but vscode does see it
Send image
i did
And then call pip
Yes so open cmd in the scripts folder
yeah pip is there but it doesnt work from vs code
It should be there
Then in scripts

No that's not the python dir go to where it's installed
yeah
And you're using python 3.10 right?

Send photo of your python dir
and it doesnt work
and i installed yaml
And then open cmd and call pip3.exe
i did
Go to your python install dir
pip doesnt exists
? You add the packet by using pip
i cant figure out how to add a packege on vs code so i tried pycharm
On Linux or windows?
Rip
pyyaml died on me

bruh wtf
And named it ELIZABETH
Trisha just had her baby while we were getting ice cream
...like, cashews...?

Paul has better connections about getting a lab
I would be interested possibly
its only a week or so
yes
Ah summer program?
im going to have to run a yes program in June
do any of you have interest in helping teens with cncs and could you get permission to use a lab?
It's next to Illinois
I lied
I believe
It's the one next to Ohio but not Illinois
I have a rough idea but
I‚Äôm not sure I could point to Iowa on a map
Yeah
It's in Iowa
No?
do we know anything about buena vista university
Damn
There‚Äôs a plethora of stock images for this

This one
werecar...
Which one is that?
You don‚Äôt have hit by car disease?
Health center cleared me

Aperantly i have this
lmao
Nooe

Oh it's the sports model that's why
Spaceman
I‚Äôm assuming the s is the model same with countryman

Double checked it said mini spaceman on the back I‚Äôm not crazy
Yeah I don‚Äôt get notifications half the time
I feel like discord has been really slow lately
No just ominous
Do you disagree

This was in my ra mail box
I'm ok, that other mark is from surgery
Just a red area
Please no.  Alcohol is the last thing you need
wha
I bet there never even was vodka
down my throat
I would
bruh i would not dump my own vodka
???
Kind of sounds like you planted it üßê
dont judge me
idk]
Why would you be opening random quad bottles anyway
Max I have a question tho
Oh I‚Äôd have taken it and walked it to them probably
if i called i would have lost the yeti
Pussy move tbh
I once brought CPS weed I found
I‚Äôd have called CPS but I‚Äôm a straight edge
yeah
i mean i dumped the vodka but if he wants the yeti
babe say yes if not for you then for me
like deadass im so tired i want a drink
also <@246405757908549633> since you broke yours, want it?
i need some bro
no
And drink it no balls all shaft
rosendal
Did you drink it
Wowee
Where?
i just found a yeti and it was full of vodka
oh ma lawd
Although that is a suggestion I would like to countersuggest that it is not a great idea to try it
Honestly maybe if you get hit by another car it will fix it?
Another 2 page paper let's gooo
If he is he can go to the er tomorrow
And I might be and that's fine
Just be careful ü´Ç
Someone else I know got hit said it was just a bump and that they were fine, and the next day they were super bruised
Getting there
Yeah
I‚Äôm sure. I think you should go to bed
Going to health center as a precaution for my scars but im convinced what I'm experiencing is just from the adrenaline
I'm like 90% sure I won't need anything
If you need medical attention then it will be on file
What is filing a report going to do for me?
You are the one who got injured
I'm sure that other people already have
You also need to file a report of what happened
I'm going to the health center tomorrow
I do not feel good
I will eat an apple and drink water
In this case anyway
Don‚Äôt force yourself to eat if you aren‚Äôt hungry
Go lay down and drink water. Maybe don't actually nap if you can help it
I'm eating but I should stop bc stomach feels very weird
Probably
Your body may well be in shock
I feel drunk
(As the youngest in this chat)
Get with the times old-timer
Ah. Always late to the party
We‚Äôve moved on miles being hit by a car is old news Guinea pigs are in
You got hit by a fucking car. That can cause serious bruising and stuff without you even realizing anything is wrong
They went to a good place they‚Äôll love it
No more smooth and rough
wiggly bois
aww ‚ù§Ô∏è
The babies have left the building
Maybe not er but like CPS at least
I do think you should get checked out though. To clarify
It‚Äôs probably adrenaline I wouldn‚Äôt worry but take it easy yes
Lisa told you not to help with teardown at the activity fair for a reason.  You should be getting rest
You should probably sit down and take it easy
I feel drunk
Ian called sps
My stomach feels weird
Athena got hit by a car today too
The way you described it sounded like a hit and run
Oh never mind
They were so sorry and stopped and stuff but I just kept eating bc I was ok
They deserve it
But you still got hit by a car and need to file a report
Well obviously it does
Just shaky
I know you physically being okay doesn‚Äôt matter
I'm fine guys
Oof unless there‚Äôs a camera at the construction site you‚Äôre out of luck
Maple south Willard
What crosswalk?
Yeah call CPS miles
2+ hours for service
There‚Äôs a total of 6 cops in Burlington
Wtf
I'm in idx now
Nah call CPS police won‚Äôt come lol
Um no call the pilice
Call CPS
I'm fine so I kept walking
They are gone
And whatever you do dont say it was your fault. Don't admit any guilt
Fuck up their insurance <:emoji_1:886745633925496894>

Call the police too
And get their insurance info
Maza blackish navy

https://www.reddit.com/r/Proxmox/comments/vjkrix/how_install_proxmox_on_hp_dl380_g7/
Did you Flash the newest available version of Proxmox to the usb stick? I had the same problem with one version of Proxmox but the newest version and another USB stick + another slot fixed the issue for me. Might also be that secure boot is active? If so, try to disable it, just to be sure.
idk what its deal is
mem tested fine
soo idk
7.1 is the only one that even boots in
and the lastes version dosent weven work
and then when i power cycle it it says no bootable found

King of looking dumb
Why does she have this puppet in her car what the fuck
lmao im reading this article on the history of chinese food in the usa
"The dishes on these largely standardized menus came from a hive-mind of restaurateurs. ‚ÄúSomething pops up and people copy it,‚Äù says Lee. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs nearly impossible to credit an original inventor for many of the classic dishes. Lee likens the process to open-source software, where anyone is free to make modifications to, or outright copy, the work of anyone else. Eventually, there emerged a pattern: If you wanted to have an American Chinese restaurant, certain menu items were expected."

Niceee
I'm doing the couch to 5k program and its working this farüòé
Oh wow
Just ran 8mph for 3 minutes
Working on more skullz

oh no if it isnt the consequences of our own actions
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/02/arts/design/met-museum-looting.html
Oh geez well maybe I did then. I wasn't feeling sick that long but that doesn't mean much with covid
I believe you but it‚Äôs possible
Paul tested over ten times and wasn‚Äôt positive until the 10th üòÇ
But idk
Well he did for sure, but I tested several times and it came back negative
Oh I figured  both you and Dillon did
No I didn't. I had some sort of sick but not covid
Didn‚Äôt you have it over the summer?
I'm really doing great this week. Sprained ankle, almost impaled by an umbrella, and now covid is highly likely
My roommate's sister is visiting and she said she wasn't feeling well this morning so she got her a covid test and it came back positive. She's been here all weekend sleeping in our roomü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I eat cereal but with lactose free milk. Dillon eats it dry
People who eat cereal are cancelled
She's mixing all the cereals
And notice...there's no marshmallows in the lucky charms
i went to call the DMV and forgot XD
/work I mean
i know üò¶
Idk it‚Äôs weird that you all have school I get it but everything else is shut down
yeah üò≠
That‚Äôs pretty lame tbh
lol im at work üò¶
I‚Äôm sure everyone is in class but does anyone want to go to Michael‚Äôs
that is a personal attack

They just finished that and they proudly showcased it to all of us
But I also think people are revisiting it because there‚Äôs some problematic stuff üòÇ
Partially because of better call Saul apparently
idk why that show is popular again
they are good
My roommates are interesting
mmmm heart beating faster
when you find an old instagram account you thought was deleted
I have to make a reservation so let‚Äôs pick a date the week of the 11th and do it
Walk üò§
If someone could drive me
Ooo I want to join
It‚Äôs kind of expensive but worth it imo

one of the best steaks of my life was from a place like that

oh cool
Like where they cook the food in front of you
what is that
Can we do hibachi sometime next week
Hmm


:/
I‚Äôm going to illegally download this object like I did with the expensive earrings
It‚Äôs interesting I like it
Can be either but this one is a sticker
have you guys ever looked at how much a birkin costs
Here
Nice. Let me know when you get here
Oh.  On my way.  I can't stay for long because I have to work on stuff for one of my events but I'll head over
<@246405757908549633>
Currently happening
<@618173952904134676>
Wait when?
I got snacks and nobody to share them with
Anyone want to stop by at my event later?
Seems reasonable

Mmm

<@246405757908549633>
I am coming to pick you up
Ah shit.  I might be late.  Im coming from north.  I forgot we weren't meeting at Vancouver anymore
Through the driveway
Ye
Come around back
Yes
At the red building?
Ok so now I should be here
It‚Äôs ok I‚Äôll get there soon
Oof
Walking
Are you driving or walking
I saw miles put in 11 and I thought that was a correction for the address whoops
Red building around back
Back up I go
Right below the sorority
Oh no
It‚Äôs the second to the top of the street
188
Uh no. 11 cliff?
Red building?
Oh no
I don‚Äôt see you so
Can someone let me in?
I think I‚Äôm at the right place
Oh that‚Äôs the time nvm
188 lol
We were going to do valcour but people changed their minds so we‚Äôre at cliff
Nvm then I can't go too far
Oh damn I had it so wrong
11 cliff I think
I have an event at noon, but I can stop by real quick. You guys said Valcour right?
Hello I am here
One second
Oopsie
Im also here tho
11 lol
What time was it supposed to be at
Oh no I thought it was at 10 my b
You can come now I guess let me get dressed
Back down the hill I go
It‚Äôs only 10 lol
I went to 111 cliff lol
Is it a sticker or patch
Not my aesthetic personally.  The red and black like that puts me on edge. But, then again, that's kinda the point right

What do we think of this vibe
Hey they 1. Found an issue, 2. Realized they couldn‚Äôt deal with it, and 3. Tried to alert everyone to it
That is...uncomfortable
I love residents
I've literally seen 20-30 people and I'm not even at sanders yet
Apparently the sidewalks by North have more traffic now than during the day
Okay can someone tell me how in the god damn this makes sense?
FLOOF

People are going to know it‚Äôs a joke right
Oops that's mine. His name is Oscar and he likes to travel

Hell yeah it's a party
Damn it‚Äôs a porch party all night

I promise I know what a raccoon is üòÇ

Ah
There was also a skunk
Yeah it‚Äôs not letting me send the video
So that was a skunk
It‚Äôs not letting my post the video but this raccoon shows up on the camera coming OUT of the porch but never entering
Does anyone know if raccoons just spawn

I promise I don‚Äôt usually spill them üòÇ
Do we want to do omelettes for brunch one weekend
I accidentally added like 3 tbsp of salt to my omelette
If we‚Äôd left when I said we would have had like an hour tomorrow
How long would we have at the store
If we leave now we could make it to the bass pro shop pyramid and back before the end of the weekend
‚Äú: ) 69 ok‚Äù <@416404018634686465>
I want to make sure the servers are in operating temp and humidity
ah
I have 2 temperature and humidity sense around the apartment to measure the climate
need back patch and jacket

what are we looking at?

The magic diff dust
What mean
<@303228816631791627> <@416998580071563264>
??
Aww cute
I asked them if I could take a pic don‚Äôt worry lol
Saw these students shoes earlier and I‚Äôm in love and 100% doing this to mine
Me sober: blabbering about random stuff 
Me high: ü´•
Well they went out with their friend. Their friend was like "hey, let's get high" and they were like "yeah okay cool" so they went and got high. Then the friend started puking litterally everywhere, my RA is like super scared of vomit so they were freaking out, and the friend called the cops because they thought they were gonna die. So my RA is scared they're gonna loose their job and ofc they're high so they're blabbering about random stuff and I had to just remind them like 3 times to go drink water, eat a snack, and go to bed
more details
They are my next door roommate btw
Guys my RA is high as a kite and they just came to me for comfort and stuff and oh boy
yee I did it
Hey <@303228816631791627> or <@416998580071563264> whenever you guys get to Lab1-3 lmk id like to talk to someone about it

Mmmm
cut the wires no balls all shaft
Mmmm
Ok
10? I think
Sure how many are coming
Hey just putting this out there but since so many people are coming this week what would y‚Äôall think of brunch at valcour instead of apartment
Her name is strawberry üçì
Ah
It was a few hours ago
Oh im at church street too
Like wtf
Like they were sitting out front of lake Champlain chocolates eating ice cream, complaining about teenagers and barking at us
Like it‚Äôs fine when it‚Äôs people you know but I was chaperoning high school students and full adults were barking at us as we walked down church st
The barking at people thing is getting cringy
Indeed  because we have monkey brain brrr
Running (and exercise) triggers fear triggers memories
Like humans used to only really run from danger and our biology is really far behind so generally when people run now it sometimes brings up "danger" memories
üòê
Cuz you're running " from" something probably
Ooh
No like WHILE running specifically
So like brain remembers bad stuff better than good stuff because like presumed danger is more important to remember to protect against it in the future. So brain run bad memories to make sure you remember the danger and to avoid it
Oops that my specialty
Ok psychology people why when run bad memories
Lol that's what the ground is for
Paul I appreciate you inviting people but we still don‚Äôt have chairs üòÇ
I'll pull up
Time
What yime
Sunday?
When
Not usually but we had a thing
What <@303228816631791627>
Ye
Abjiah coming to brunch?
Does bhs get out rn?

I finished some drawing that one of my kids gave me the outline of. She told me to finish them by Friday and show her the finished product. Like a game
:(
I accidentally said something rude to a student I feel bad
Or Saturday late afternoon like 6
I can be around on Sunday
I'll see if I can pack most of it tonight.  I have an event at 8 and duty tomorrow night so it would probably have to be, like, in a few hours
Tonight I‚Äôm the most free tho
I need to sort out my tags
I‚Äôm kind of busy this weekend but if you don‚Äôt mind like early night time
Ew
Can someone with a car help me move to north this weekend? I'm going to keep the amount of stuff I'm moving down to just a couple boxes.  I have to spend at least 3 nights out of the week at North and at that point its easier and more comfortable to just move the important stuff like toiletries, clothes, sheets, etc over there.
stomach hurty
Deal?
but i also coulnt if i wanted to is the point
Eek
i never will shop there
yeah hobby lobby is shit


Ture but I personally try when I can and if enough people boycott something then yes it will do something
Basically yeah
no ethical consumption under capitalism

And you have an artist here who will do it for freeüôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
i dont think boycotts do anything but also if i wanted to go to hobby lobby i would have to drive 3 hours
Half of the employees at the one around here wear pride pins on their uniform lol
Boycott if possible
Yeah they do that
^
Hobby lobby hates gays

I can make anything you want art wise too. Just send me what you want and I will do it. I need to be building a professional portfolio anyway
maybe we can go look for stuff at resource
i have some canvases
I could send a primed loose canvas and you could make it like a handprint wall or something
im hoping to try and find some science and school posters
That was a whole thing
for the creation museam the ceo owns
Yeah that too
except for the smuggling artifacts thing
Ah yeah they are Christian run. You wouldn't know it unless you went to like a specific row of the store tho lol
maybe i make the kids make art
and also the whole smuggling ancient artifacts thing is a bit funky imo
we tried to go to hobby lobby once but theyre closed sundays
Cool deal. I gotchu famüëå
i mean if you want to, im going to hang some photos once i get my pictures back from the show
I have time this weekend to work
Shit. Want me to do some art and mail it?
Wait really?
14-18+
we dont have hobby lobby in vermont
oh cool
What age group?
Also, hobby lobby has nice classroom artwork. Like a watercolor map of the world, states with capitols, stuff like that
i also only have like 2 outlets üò≠
gotcha. i have some white ones that change color
Yeah no I would get some but keep them on like a slow twinkle or just solid color setting. Fairy lights are cute
i have some fairy lights though, those might be nice

like most led strips i know change color a lot which could be overstimulating
light strips are a nice idea, im getting light covers next week hopefully. maybe leds would be distracting if the focus is mental health and work
Ah gotcha. Floor stickers?
cant do throw rugs because it makes the room no longer wheelchair accessible
Some! Can I suggest 1) throw rugs and 2)the LED strip wall lights
Does that help at all
i have used like all of the slidescarnival slides at this point unfortunatel
Ah gotcha. Slidescarnival has some cool slideshow templates
yeah i need only open source/free stuff since i graduated unfortunately
I also like Adobe spark,  which is free through my school
Oooh I do for my research defenses.  Thanks!
its not exactly open source, but its images, videos, audio, etc all copyright free or limited copyright

Oh god.  Juliana just sent pictures of the p card to the discord so people could make online purchases.
am i supposed to disagree with his actions
Andrew Joseph Stack III was a freedom fighter...
Idk they use terroristic tactics so I wouldn't say they aren't wrong
idk it just feels weird to start the convo that way with young people. id explain who they are and say they are regarded by some countries as a terrorist organization
they were freedom fighters tho
They aren't wrong
but the irish car bomb (drink) would not exist without the ira so
idk how we feel about car bombs
true
depends on if your thing is from a British perspective or an Irish perspective
idk if maybe i got some biased history but my irish culture classes always regarded them as heros
lol
the irish republican army
idk who the ira are
also the teacher in the room over just referred to the ira as a terrorist organization
v sad
the video is cool thp

I don‚Äôt like Craigslist
Bleach and Craigslist
I‚Äôm getting art up soon
It looks good for 0 budget for sure
I have to source everything
It's not ur fault at all Charlotte
Just being honest not your fault
Guyssss the budget is literally just garbage I find
Damn miles digging on my classroom üò≠
It looks like the backrooms
This room makes me anxious
Y‚Äôall will have to check it out at some point
I‚Äôm hanging a tapestry in the blue wall area
My pillows and books are coming this weekend. And hopefully someday I‚Äôll have a bookshelf
I‚Äôd like to get a floor rug for aesthetics but that would make it inaccessible
FBI interrogation  room
Unstimulating

Good buzz, they are always nice if you are to their family
Sure thingüëç
i might come back to you on this i dont think i know anyone else who did mission trips
Dillon went to a methodist church and when I heard what it was like I was like ??
got it
No not catholic. I grew up in a Baptist church but I consider myself nondenominational now
it was a different denomination
youre not catholic right
and visiting their churches is really cool too
yeah thats different i think thats fine
I feel like that's just.. wrong
We held our own services wherever we were staying and like prayed before working but never conversion trips
disaster relief
mission trips traditionally are more like intentionally spreading the gospel
yeah thats more service work
Yeah I don't think that's how mission trips are supposed to be.  I've been in several but we didn't shove Jesus down anyone's throat.  We did stuff like hurricane cleanup
Our evangelism and discipleship initiatives focus on strategically saturating each community with the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The long-term strategy involves daily house to house evangelism and weekly Bible studies (discipleship). The weekly Bible studies are led by a few of our local African staff who have been journeying with us for many years and have a passion to make disciples. Our aim is to train up local Africans to reach their neighbors with the Gospel; Africans reaching Africans. It is clear that the harvest is not only ripe, but is rotting away. It is our mandate to advance the Gospel within these communities with a team of local staff, volunteers and short-term missionaries; each play an important and strategic part in advancing the Gospel throughout the country of South Africa.
for my thesis thing im reading this one webpage from impact africa and just look at this
god i hate mission trips
Idk they burn a lot but yeah itchy no
Itching not normal
U allergic
Red onions make my mouth burn like fire and my throat itch
Idk the yellow and white are my fava
They have different levels of spice. I think red are the least along with vidalia?
I'll eat golden ones like an apple
Its good I love onions
They‚Äôre full of acid
No they def are that‚Äôs the whole thing
So onions aren't supposed to make your mouth burn ???
Bees are friends üêù
Hehe

did you know that we stopped using the word to describe humans not because it was offensive but because it was incorrect? like a true hermaphrodite has fully formed male and female reproductive organs but that doesnt happen in people
i learned a lot about hermaphrodism yesterday
I just do 12 loops and call it a day
the top is more legible but the signerature is never legible
Ik the b in the cursive Campbell is wrong

Which on is more legible
Settle a debate
lol
these two points seem to contradict one another
They're all coming from different stops and getting off at different places so its not even a group of friends going out somewhere
I think its really interesting how a lot of people that ride the bus know each other.  Its like Cheers on wheels
üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è
Uh oh.  Its begun
I think I pissed it off
Ah that'll do it haha
Idk all my other jobs I‚Äôve had I had to be there at 7:30
Teacher life?
What has my life become that sleeping until 7:30 feels late
The bus should be a safer place since there's at least a few other people on it.  I appreciate the thought though.
Buses are safe tho
You keep telling me how people be getting mugged and stuff so be careful
?
Be careful on the bus babe
np.  I wouldn't wish this situation on anyone
but thanks man
cool
just got a week extension do im ok for now
Ah right.  I'm going around 8-11
class
I'm taking the bus to Walmart tomorrow.  Do you want to come with?
I think it's ridiculous they make you guys (Kay too) go to the meetings when you have a virus that literally shut down the country
i havent gathered the materials
and i need to push an event back a week bc im not prepared to do one on friday
maybe idk im so tired and im so behind on the fucking connections bc i have covid
You should probably tell Ian about that because they can't expect to make the meetings half an hour longer this year then expect you to stay nearly an hour past that time.  They have no right forcing you guys to be awake at this hour when you aren't on duty
i need to talk to them after to : (
Get his ass
yeah
Dude what the fuck.  Is that Josh?
I gave Charlotte the ability to view the camera and she seems to be having too much fun
STLL IN MEETING
God damn
i am still in hall meeting
i am so tired
yeah but idk he gives me bad vibes
He's figuring it out.  Juliana had a rough time the first semester too.
i really dont think he's going to make a good ac
I just don't get how Fay literally saw me say I'm locked out, asked me if the door was just stuck, then never looked back
im sorry man
My temp ID (surprise surprise) wasn't configured correctly
ah
I'm locked out.  I forgot to include that part
I cant just call CPs because then in 3 minutes ill have to call them again to let me into Sanders
what?
Not me waiting nearly half an hour outside 396 on rounds because the entire North RA staff is still in their weekly meeting and Fay hasn't messaged me back after I told him "No humidity isn't holding the door shut"
Sound

ik but josh likes them
Those have been lately discredited

Miles want to come get drunk in a basement Friday

I'm getting followed brb
for the first time? wow where have you been for the past few years
Mental Retardation was the clinical diagnosis for a variety of mental disorders. It was all encompassing. Again, the inaccuracy of one word as all encompassing drove this phrase out of standard conversation by the early 2000s. Unfortunately, it is still used in the pejorative to hurt people. In its full form ‚ÄúMental Retardation‚Äù has an educational value to learn about the evolution of language around and care of those who are neurodivergent, but its counterpart ‚Äúretarded‚Äù is widely considered to be a slur. Mental retardation is no longer used in new clinical documentation, as it was deemed offensive and inaccurate by advocates then officially by the Social Security Administration. Using the phrase mental retardation ‚Äúoften results in misunderstandings about the nature of the disorder and those who have it‚Äù (SSA, 2013).
Also just got barked at by a person for the first time
Yes
can you read a sentence and tell me if this was an appropriate use of a slur

https://quizlet.com/158652352/chapter-2-quiz-flash-cards/
But also that it‚Äôs racist to hold positions of power as a white person
wack
To being told that it‚Äôs racist to make poc be in positions of power that relate to poc. Like diversity directors etc
I‚Äôm losing it (defensiveness) which is a white supremacy reaction
Guys
I wither without my protein

Not necessarily but it‚Äôs very white centric in terms of racism

Anti racism training is as expected
Okay I think the tech people might enjoy this reading for my computer architecture class

Criminalistics: An Introduction to Forensic Science
Which
damn text book i need is 200$
I agree that usually you don‚Äôt need them but I will say when we used to use a shared app with everyone‚Äôs info it was helpful to get the numbers for emergencyish situations. Like when I saw students in pearl smoking I wanted to text the pearl ras instead of taking over the ir. There has to be middle ground though, and it shouldn‚Äôt come from thd it should be a different system
I'm going to propose to reslife that they somehow make the phone numbers of people not visible to RAs in THD. If we don't ever need to use them then we should not be able to see them and now this is most likely the second time someone has used THD to find my phone number
just smells like blood
stable now
this was like 2 second after taking it out

Band aid?
aw shit im bleeding a lot from shot
Yep
was it josh lol?
But now I do
Before I didn't want to get him in trouble
This was the last straw
I called the ACOC
Yeah he did the same thing in mcdonald last year
did i tell you i heard from kay that he creeped out on someone else?
This is getting majorly creepy
Did you pick up?? What did he say
that is it
Wtf
jimmy just called me.
Glad I dropped out
Damn they‚Äôre onto us
ah
I don‚Äôt think he was admitted but it was probably a good reality check anyway
yeah im suprised he went to hospital
It could have gone worse
Yeah I guess they just gave him a call and said someone in the community was concerned which made him seek medical attention
really? i am very suprised
That's good.  And interesting
They were really helpful and even said they‚Äôve heard the spider man thing before
Yeah I did do that. That‚Äôs what we were talking about with the first call
Or a crisis helpline if it's really bad
You could call a non emergency police number and they could help
yeah ig but im not moving enough
Better now than later imo even though it sucks
Hey I know it‚Äôs the first week but they usually just go over the syllabi
no
Symptoms yet?
big covid sad
I‚Äôm kidding I shaved a cat
Yeah I hit it
Was that an animal?
Tresspassing

Ah
Don‚Äôt they give ras the first call stickers anymore
First call is an organization in chittenden county for mental health
You called ahead to who?
I called first call. Wasn‚Äôt sure what else to do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI-cxvXuLvg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDacjrSCeq4
I‚Äôve been trying to convince him to go but he thinks he‚Äôs spider man
He‚Äôs not yet
If he's at the hospital can they help him?
I‚Äôm kind of wondering if I should call someone even though I know the emergency resources here are shit
He‚Äôs very clearly manic right now
I'm confused

honestly the reality of burlington is that a significant amount of queer people find each other through the people they hookup with which is unfortunate for people in monogamous relationships who want to connect with other queer people
yes

When I binged all 200 episodes of it‚Äôs always sunny in two weeks and hallucinated Danny Devito
If you hear house in your brain you need to take a break tho
red pill
no
That‚Äôs good
i am suck in a simulation
That show is a rollercoaster though
I can‚Äôt right now because I can‚Äôt get into anything
I used to do that
Man relatable
ive been watching house for like 9 hours
Life‚Äôs easier when you don‚Äôt have to pick out the bad meat
It‚Äôs so good
I call it small bean
that looks good

ah
Katie??? Yes
It‚Äôs good and changes the series
is he still with that ED girl?
I like that one
im watching the episode of house where he gets shot
He‚Äôs at 194
No he was only there briefly.
speaking of him is he still at skyzone?
burke didn't tell me\
Go to the big tree burke told us about
It‚Äôs like my hall last year
i mean i can but like idk where to go
I figured you might be able to go outside, just not in anywhere
i want to go outsideeeeeeeee
and he was myles
ive only met irl one other miles
I've never met another dillon
Well then
This is comical.  11 people in the hall and we have two Lucas' two Jacks, and two Dillons (the other one spelled Dylan)
I figure ill just wing it.  Im not planning on spending very long in North so ill probably just bring a duffel bag of stuff to leave the first night and a bag with my computer and things ill need in both halls
Oh did you still need help moving stuff today I low key spaced that
You can take it at winter break if you want
One came with my apartment
You could've taken mine
*by request of the AC

Food
Mans is just chilling with my good
i will
Miles you should try the sauce I got from the Indian market it's really good

going to put my new sauce on it
Yummy
Since it‚Äôs close quarters in the city the smoke is annoy g
i ordered mexican
Emissions mostly
why?
Does that mean I can have an indoor fire
Did y‚Äôall know you can‚Äôt have an outdoor fire in Burlington?
ah
Mom didn‚Äôt like that story
My parents are taking a sailing class today at the sailing center in Burlington so of course I told her about the time I went there and they dropped the boom on someone‚Äôs head and she went to the hospital
the boom
wym?
So did y‚Äôall know people don‚Äôt like it when you tell them about watching someone get a concussion on a sailboat before they go sailing
Their toys and hides are gross but they need to acclimate before I wash anything else
Gub wigglies
!! Hewo frend !!
I‚Äôm going to feed them in a sec
Yes but I just took them out and put them in a box
are they scared

Lmao gotcha
Or igloo depending on the season
You can sleep in the tent
The pigs are moving on top of the rats I just need to scrub out the cage first
Oh wow
I‚Äôd love to say there‚Äôs plenty of space but
Oof
I'll go and crash with you guysüòÇ
So they max me at 2 credits a semester I think
Though you‚Äôll have it before me because I don‚Äôt want to pay üòÇ
Oh that‚Äôs fun. Me too
Haha I wish. I may end up coming up there on trips next year because I'm gonna do my masters degree online
well come up next semester
This is my last year
you should do a semeser abroad here
The minimum here is like 7.25/hr which is no where near enough to meet the cost of living
Yeah the cost of living is higher there so that would make sense
I was complaining to my neighbor about the pay I get as a teacher and she said she makes less and I get that but me saying 16 isn‚Äôt enough for me is saying that 16 isn‚Äôt enough for anyone. I think the minimum in Burlington should be 20 üòÇ
That's great. I'm glad for you guys lol
Yeah we have decent minimum wage here
I get paid 11.50 at my job at the autism society which is much better than most part time jobs for students
Bro what the hell
I‚Äôm glad I have the extra but I shouldn‚Äôt have to
Yes I‚Äôm working that job as well. So for 31.5 hours of the week I make 16 and then 10 hours I make 23
can you apply for that?
what the fuck
The after school tutor makes 18-23, as a full time teacher I make 16
study abroad at uvm
Ya want to know what‚Äôs terrible?
Bruh I wish we had yalls pay rate
Bonus if you can do math and speak French but it‚Äôs cool if not
Oh totally changing the subject but if any of you need a job and are free 3:30-5:30 m-th hit me up it starts at 18/hr
BABIES!!!
ah
They don‚Äôt wake up until like 3 pm usually
It‚Äôs only 12 they‚Äôre still asleep
how are the rats liking them
She was in a bad situation so I wanted to help and I definitely have knowledge of them
She needed them gone today so I‚Äôm just fostering
omg lol
Yes they were free
did you buy the ginue pigs of criagslist?
??
Introducing marshmallow and vanilla our temporary critters
Surprise
I‚Äôve never heard of that
i had some really good mexican food at rehoboth recently
Personally if I‚Äôm feeling like I want Mexican I usually go for chipotle because they have the things where you get to try a bunch of dipping sauces and ü•∞
It‚Äôs the only one near me, most people hate the Mexican food up here but I‚Äôve always thought it was tasty
Not compared to a lot of places anyway
No
is it $$$?
El gato
anyone know of any good mexican restaurants around?
Driving
What da dog doin
Lol

Since I have the same lamp
Probably actually
But I'm all set, just an idea
Could be the specific light you have, I've had ones that burn like hell, and do the same thing as ones that are fine
And they use the uv too
I‚Äôve never had a reaction at an actual salon tho
You could try a different light
Yeah that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm guessing
Stuff burns
It could be from the uv light
Yikes
Do you want the set tho I think I‚Äôm allergic
I have experience with the uv stuff sorta lol
Because I used to hate it and I thought I‚Äôd get another at home kit but my fingers are covered in blisters
Does anyone do gel nail polish
ig i will walk down to the water and run to try and avoid people
lol
No I was eating pasta salad and complaining about how there‚Äôs no hot pasta salad but I realized that‚Äôs just pasta. But there‚Äôs nothing stopping me from making pasta with the same flavors
were you pasta salad
I dreamt about pasta salad
absolutely homie
rain check
i deeply appreciate fruit therapy
if i didn't have covid id buy you another fruit
(dont scart me actually im okay)
tho i should prolly do one for myself at this point like when I tell you it has been one thing after another today I am not being dramatic at all
one of my residents
about whom?
I also just had to file a long ass scart report
(i wont thats a dumb idea)
should I just respond "im gay" and say nothing else
mans is 15 years older than me too
could do like work place harrasment
those dudes are scary and fucked up
idk but he's combat trained
I honestly dont really know what theyd even do tho
i plan to
Like this is how my ex was when my friends thought he was going to murder me
You need to talk to Juliana again (I‚Äôm assuming you plan to) but this is getting really creepy
the practice canister is good

He stole the liquor from the party
Have you seen this man? He is wanted for 5 counts of armed robbery and grand theft auto
Thanks. I've been through my parents (and their s/os) divorcing probably 5 times now? Still doesn't hurt any less
That sucks. I have a slight understanding about that situation but not to the extent that you‚Äôre experiencing it. I just wish your family the best of luck and I hope that that transition can be as smooth as possible
Thanks... I've been dealing with this for a little over a month I think. He walked out on us a couple weeks before I went back to school. Like a week before dillon got up there with you guys
Bruh I‚Äôm so sorry about that
He never cleaned once in their 12 years of marriage,  didn't even take his own plates to the sink.  She waited on him hand and foot and put up with his bullshit for so long
The house was in his name amd he did most of the renovations before they were married. In NC, if they get the house amd do renovations together then she would legally be obligated to half of the house's value. But since he put so much into it before they were married she doesn't seem to be entitled to a much.  Gonna talk to a lawyer though because it's bullshit
that sucks bro im sorry, can she sue for the house?
My mom and asshole stepdad are divorcing for good and even though he's keeping the house (worth 250k) he's only giving her 20k and that's just to pay off the car. I can't believe him and honestly I don't even think he cares that I'm gone even though its been 12 years
thanks but i am not prepared
VHS
I can deliver you a whinnie the poo BHS
Yay they got the old guy
ig its time to watching fucking twilight again so my room isnt fucking silent
i am so sad they took bones off prime rn]
I mean you‚Äôre right across the street I‚Äôd say just go check
It should be it‚Äôs a Friday but orientation is weird
Is the dining hall still open?  I didn't get food because I was working on getting a test before I ate around a bunch of people packed into a tiny room
Do you want the picture?
That‚Äôs what a covid+ person would say
My test came back negative
good
No
ok
Or whatever
Ask if they want to meet on google

Hi Professor,

This is really not how I wanted the semester to start, but at this point it is out of my control. I am an RA so I have been on campus for 2 weeks now, and today (8/26/2022) I tested positive for Covid-19. I am actively working with the Student Health Center in order to determine when I am able to return to class but so far, if I do not develop symptoms, the earliest I can return is Thursday (9/1/20220). I will read the syllabus on my own time, of course, but is there anything else I will miss or should know? And are there any assignments I should hand in before Thursday? Again, I am so sorry the semester is starting this way.

Respectfully,
Miles Campbell
```
was your computer near the window?
I left my windows open in my room and I'm off campus and I don't care enough to come back because I don't want to go back to campus until I have to for duty
Today has been hell

Ya kno
Yeah either way
Also the hope is that I still *won't* be positive in a few hours
Mmm true
^
I‚Äôd wait. He‚Äôd still be positive a few hours from now when there isn‚Äôt a major electrical storm
Oh right.  They're closed until tomorrow.  Also I won't ask you to come in the rain.  I can head over after though so you don't have to move?
The girl stuck in her car in the parking lot had a window where she could safely get inside but she didn‚Äôt take it and is still in the car
I just don‚Äôt want to walk in the rain lol
I have an extra rapid if you want it
<@246405757908549633> Do you want one I‚Äôm like 2 blocks from campus?
^
they are at the school store
I might be lucky and still have immunity from June but we'll see.
You could doordash an at home test
i feel fine
Rip
Welp.  Covid testing ended 4 hours ago so I'll just wait until Monday when classes start

I‚Äôm prepared for a covid outbreak when classes start
You saw them after though? Maybe you gave it to them

Lmao I know

I can Pavlov you with way more stuff if you want
You don't have to apologize.  I just think its funny that I've been pavloved
I def saw hail so I thought it was

If it's within the school budget I don't believe so
But for same job?
It was a fun job when I wasn‚Äôt dying
Which is super nice
Sodexo will now pay 15+ an hr because they aren't limited to the schools budget
Which didn‚Äôt last long but I‚Äôm sure you can
I did workstudy for wgc then did regular pay for Sodexo
Yes you can
I got approved for max work study but never used it
?
Can I be work stuff and part time at the same time
I'll throw hands

He really wants me in during the week
Nice

<@303228816631791627> <@416998580071563264>

theres free guinea pigs on craigslist that are making me sad
im on marketplace rn and messaged a few people
Should look at Craigslist
yeah and i was thinking a coffee table if they want to sit on the floor and work
oh so like bean bags n stuff?
we want more flexible seating but i want to keep the table if they want a traditional workspace
Perhaps you should move the table out from the wall and get some fold up chairs
is the max
6
How man kids will you have in there at a time?

which to be fair isnt in the pic
theres a big one on the wall
You can have my white board if you want

Oh my god

ü§£
Sometimes I forget I go to mall school
There‚Äôs one at BCA for 20$ <@425781751516889118>
Yes
Good call
Same reason I decided not to do porn freshman year
Oh shit that's right
Unfortunately
If any of the drawings made their way out into the world I‚Äôd lose my license
Honestly I would do it.  Nudity doesn't phase me and getting paid to sit there? Like sold
Mostly because I can‚Äôt sit still
They were hiring nude models at champ a few years ago. I considered it but thankfully decided not to lmao
We're gonna get to draw both from clothed student models and nude professional models
I dropped out of art school so I never got to draw from a model
Omg I'm taking one right now
Even tho republican and democrat are two sides of the same coin but dem candidates pretend to care about green energy
Not to rehash the conversation from earlier but assuming a republican president takes office after Biden and they hold office for 8 years will the infrastructure really change much
Does anyone want to take a life drawing class with me
Amd they litterally do t give a fuck if we drink and stuff
Babe my RA, also my next door roommate, is telling us about they drink and trip acid and are addicted to nicotine and shit
<@246405757908549633> how is hall meeting
Miles and I are already at soup but I accept your decision begrudgingly
I think I'm good for today
I need to know asap tho
I can come pick you up
Or just come vibe idk
Second dinner
So? Do it again
Just had dinner
<@618173952904134676> <@293489371309670410> want to go to church st to eat soup
And also hint of lime chips
That‚Äôs how I feel about my parents garlic powder
Why does everything have so much sugar in it im trying not to get diabetes

I need bullet proof glass
Fuck i forgot they break
They break out the window and rip off the steering column and got for a ride
I usually park at Lakeside
Don‚Äôt park near public high schools
Its locked, don't they need access to the steering wheel
I would look out then
If someone does that to my kia I will become violent
Omg
The Kia boys are based
I know
After hall meeting ig
That's what I was talking about
When Ben Jerry's
<@416404018634686465> stealing ur car is a tiktok trend
Yeah I just hope we can get there in ten years
It will absolutely take time, and if a better infrastructure bill could pass in the future I could totally see more states becoming carbon neutral and being able to produce batteries wouldn't have such a nasty impact
If Susan says it‚Äôs sus I believe her
Nuclear converted into electricity is cleaner as well you get a better return
ah yes I can't wait to drive my nuclear car lol
Cali can probably do it but what about people who live in low income areas with less power grid structure etc
Nuclear all the way
And the battery emissions is an issue with hybrids too, you need to drive a Prius for 60 years to get a net neutral on the carbon put into creating the batteries
I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs a bad idea flat out but with our current indersteucture and the issues with charging the e vehicles we already have I just hope things completely turn around in 10 years
and even if the electricity is produced by burning coal, it's still more efficient than gasoline
well you see, some of that energy can be renewable. California actually had a day this summer when they were actually carbon neutral
and the emissions from large scale lithium ion batteries
are people dumb? where do they think the power comes from to charge the cars
damn california just announced they will ban the sale of gas cars after 2035
oh good point\
Was this softmore year
obviously i agree but i have no memory in saying this
Oh I didn't know they did that
idk why would you get on a waitlist and go to surgical consults if it weren't real
I thought they were just claiming they were and they wernt actually
And at the time the media believed this is why he did what he did
So did y‚Äôall know the Unibomber is trans?
Is burns from those island
theres also a resident in my hall named Lion
I did get weird vibes from the burns kid
OK SO THERE IS 3 OPTIONS OF WHO THIS PARENT COULD BE AND ONE OF THEM IS IN MY HALL
Satire
That‚Äôs what made me think it was a tire
And the fish sticks
Right I‚Äôm so concerned

What exists
In my theories of counseling class motivational interviewing doesn't even exist
They cary it at a lot of ice cream shops around here
its either fruit flavored or vanilla, but the bagel was just plain
i know of superman ive never seen it in person

Does?? That not exist up there?
ew what is that

rainbow
Ah, the wrong way
Abijah writes his 2 from bottom right to top left
Superman flavored bagel?
Hmmm
I wanted cheese but this was what was in stock
Shaws makes their own in house and they‚Äôre tasty
It‚Äôs just a plain bagel
That looks disgusting

I do pack rolls
It‚Äôs not unfortunately:)
Jesus fucking christ I hope that's satire. I know that's wishful thinking though
This is satire right
Move in day?
Its a recent development for me

Ain't enough
Bruh

When I used to hang out with the church group I saw a kid eat 8 along with like three cups of Powerade
Eat more
Ain't enough
Two hard boiled eggs for dinnerüëç
Not completely.  I still have my room in Bankus, but I'll be doing duty rounds in North.  Technically I don't have to do anything for Bankus while I'm up there, but I'm not cruel to Grace so I'm still holding events for Bankus and I'm going to help out with what I can.  I want to be able to spend maybe every other night in each (since the first week with first years is important) so I might put together a backpack of essentials to carry between the two with Bankus as my home base.
Yeah.  South was informed at dinner.  I was told at 2 but asked not to say anything until then.
What does that mean?
damn i failed
Ah
yeah i chose 2 but who wrote this test
Thats 3rd?
yeah but imagine saying 'i double dog dare you to sign this'
2nd
lmao

Cock and Ball Torture
or hoping you can control them better
more or less its just talking out the feelings and hoping they go away
I have no experience and no nothing about cbt
Cbt works in some cases but like for me I went through a lot of therapist before I realized talk therapy wasn't for me
just personally. im sure it works for some people
i also hate cbt
Motivational interviewing is bullshit
Mind you of there were no other disks attached it would boot fine

Okay so for those of you who haven't heard yet, I'll be the temporary RA for North Hall until spots open up around campus for those residents.  Is there anyone available Saturday to help me transport a few things?  Probably just a duffel bag of clothes and a box of everything else but its a long walk to lug it.

Honestly I don‚Äôt think this is one of the situations where you just let it go because I have a feeling it will become a thing if not.

188 cliff

Alienware moment
Oh and that option is hidden.  you have to enter a command to unhide it
I just found out that Windows has a feature that automatically boosts your CPU so that might explain why my temps are always so high.  I know right now its summer and I don't have AC, but its been high in the past regardless

But it‚Äôs over now right

So how was motivational interviewing

But yeah I could see where that would be confusing because pollo is chicken in spanish
Oh no Pollo as in poultry
Genuinely asking not trying to pick it apart
Totally my brain but wouldn‚Äôt pollotarian just mean chicken since pollo is chicken
Yeah it either has to be 100% chicken or turkey. I don't even eat things with beef broth in it
Most hot dogs are mostly chicken these days but I know you‚Äôre strict about it
üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èpollotarian, don't eat hotdogs
2 typically
poll: how many hot dogs do you eat in one go
Oof
Screwed a screw into glass
Okay yep Yknow that‚Äôs my bad

I doubt this is the case,  but she may have had a silent migraine.  I've had quite a lot, but normal migraines are more common for me. If she was acting otherwise normal then I dont think she had one,  but silent migraines symptoms are
"With silent migraine, you may experience:¬†Moderate to severe aura symptoms, such as noticing strange smells, having numbness or tingling in the arms and neck, trouble hearing, weakness in arms, and loss of speech. Sensitivity to bright lights and/or loud noises. Sensitivity to particular smells." https://www.singlecare.com/blog/silent-migraine/
Depends.  Some like the comfort,  but most Christian/ catholic people don't have those.

Cute for sure but like from what I heard he‚Äôs in the cage all day and he got ear mites almost immediately
Oh he‚Äôs still Alive? She does not take care of it
her bunny chris is fucking adorable though.  She feeds him cheerios.  Not alot but from what sandi found, he should only have like 5 and she gives him a small handful seemingly multiple times per day
God already breezy is being annoying
The books weren't ones I recognized so I don't remember them.  I remember grace said it sounded like some sort of psychology major
We also did the first floor of Rowell with Cristian since Breezy had a headache.  Only the first floor since it was late.  She was saying it was a migraine but theres no way because she was still operating like normal and moving fine but talking just a little softer than normal, which means at a normal volume.
I love that for you though.
What books
We went late on room checks since we checked ceilings.  We found over 20 glass vodka and assorted liquor bottles in the ceiling of one room.  Apparently the Bankus sword (nerf) was broken and thrown away last year.  In just one room, we found a box of beer pong supplies, rented books from the campus store, a sustain champlain water bottle, an acceptance mug, and a whole ass (broken) camping chair
Good
I spent an hour petting Evie the cat
Also I saw a necklace today that was Mary (I think) and on the back it said ‚ÄúI am a catholic if I am in a serious accident please call a priest‚Äù is that normal or

The verdict is; guilty in the highest level of biting, what is the sentence?
Biting
What are the charges?
That is true. A criminal
He is guilty
That little hanging thing is cute

What do you think about this
I hate the robots that don‚Äôt listen to you
I hate being on hold
That cat is adorable as all heck
If you hit it fast enough you go under it
That's why highway moose fatalities are low
Yeah if you are going fast enough that happens
or like fly over the top since theyre so tall'
Yeah üòÇ
yeah i remember her saying it was so that the moose would roll off instead of ccrushing her lol
Oh I know what you mean, it's what they put in convertibles aswell to make the windshield and a pillar stronger
her license plate was mootmoot or smthn
im 99% sure it was  a volvo but the part i am talking about i beleive is called a windshield pillar
I think I know what your talking about
Ye
im trying to come up with the name of it give me a few seconds
Sound like a new england thing
Huh
like my gran had a car specifically so that she wouldnt be crushed by a moose
thatss why they reinforce the roofs on some cars
Pls forgibe
Alright sorry for killing the mood XD
And the best part is if you hit them in a car, you hit it's legs, and it's body slams down onto the windshield and the roof, and sometimes crushes you
Big murder deer
Yes
Thanks for coming to my Ted talk
Murder deer
Yeah Soo I mean they are cool but also like death

He won‚Äôt let me go outside
We don't have wifi
How so?
Paul is boring me
Bored
Baby :3
Curry nightü§§
She's like the sweetest cat ever but she has SUCH a rbf
Grumpy

I‚Äôm sure like you said they just forgot but it stings when people forget stuff like that
Ugh I‚Äôm so sorry
I mean I know they'll understand when they remember I asked them but yeah
That's lame I'm sorry
I know they probably just forgot but it was already pretty emotionally vulnerable for me to ask to do it and agh to have to remind them that they in fact gave me permission to do this
me: asks juliana and ian that if I can go to a vigil on UVM campus for kyla's friend who was killed from 5-6pm (during dinner) and they both say yes
Juliana: Hey maeve why weren't u at dinner???
I think you can get a junior like educational license or something
But yeah it's more an emergency thing
Dad has a license but he said that no one is gonna try to hunt down a portable ham radio unless you're doing something malicious lmao
Don't talk to anyone without a license
New toy, any input or advice?
Oh no, Miles thinks a PC is close to a dick
V cozy
Ooh! Nice!
Work in progress

I'm not letting him anywhere near my moms lmao
Paul‚Äôs a milf hunter
Waste not want not.  Ill just borrow Max's kitchen
Whatevers left of it

Charlotte wants to know

Dillon where is Karen staying?üçë
Is that what you call your dick these days?

Hmm OK but ur on thin ice
No ill just get a new one with my mom
Oh isn‚Äôt your mom still here?
If Paul moves his car I could bring you to target <@246405757908549633>
Anybody have an extra pillow they don't want?  I thought mine were packed but I have absolutely no idea where they might be if they aren't in any of my boxes
Okay max walked up to me and asked for a hug.  I didnt hear anyone call to me from across any street
I am
I'm notü•≤
So is everyone here?
Dillon didn't ignore me
Dillon don't be an ass

Thank
Ah
House where make food not have food
A what
im starving I hate living in an ingredients household
9 hours bc I used the bathroom more than once
I am arrived
I'm on the road rn
I'm so sad I wasn't quicker on the draw because I just passed the madman with "hentai" on their license plate
No my mommy is driving me
Him and miles both have 16+ hour drive so I think they split it
Why
Wait are you going to start driving at 2am
Have a safe drive guys
Personally I don‚Äôt want to stay up but I also can‚Äôt sleep ever
Damn
and yes I've been up for 18 hours
I'm supposed to be up in one hour and on the road as soon as possible.  I'm still planning on packing my computer and taking a shower first though.  I'm hoping to catch my dad and sister when they get back from the concert they went to so I can say buy.
What time do you start the drive dillion?
Hehe I supposed to be up in 4 hours and 20 minutes
I was worried my feet would break but I got bluetooth shoes so they good
Haven't  you been up for like 18 hours
I'm glad you enjoyed it üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I went running Thursday for the first time and it was great
Dude I'm dying right now because I woke up at a reasonable hour, walked all day, and am still awake at my normal peak activity hour
Me tooü§û
I really fucking hope my ID is in my old wallet
This used to be my only time to surf the net without parents looking over my shoulder and I never recovered
F
Like I am up because I wanted to spend as much time with dillon as I could before he hits the road in like an hour but holy shit my body hates me rn
Oof I think I lost my champ id
How in God's name do some of you stay up late like this every day
My artists have always like body taped a bandage to it and told me to take it off after an hour or two to clean it
I always use aquaphor on my tattoos bc it‚Äôs good for healing
I scratched wrong and pulled out part of my tattoo so a lot can go wrong
Lol ill keep that in mind
I always used menthol lotion and that is not good but damn it felt good.
Just antibacterial soap, water, and neutral lotion
Couple reasons. First off it‚Äôs like 50/50 whether your tattoo artist loves or hates it. all I know hate it. Secondly, if you take it off wrong it can ruin the tTtoo. Thirdly, your tattoo should be washed immediately and exposed to air and never covered. Fourthly, idk about you but personally I can‚Äôt handle adhesives on my skin
Why?
If you ever get a larger one never ever get that second skin sticker stuff
Same. I had to sacrifice a pair of leggings because I couldn‚Äôt cover the tattoo

Is your car going to be okay?
Subaru moment. I hope you can fix it up easily
(My tailpipe fully fell off)
My car broke down 20 minutes after I had left ithaca so I had to wait two and a half hours for a tow truck to show up but Kyla came and now om spending one more night

Congrats I think?
Next time you guys send him back send him with condoms smh
Dillon will be up there woth you guys sundayüò¢
Although I could swing by during lunch so IG don't worry about Sunday
Maybe if we met up Sunday night I could also get the monitor and keyboard from you at the same time or Monday night
Ah lol
I‚Äôm not speaking for him in a bad way he‚Äôs just busy atm but I‚Äôm in the room with him
Yeah he can do that or I can steal his keys or something
I just need to get let into their office I can move everything myself

Wow congrats!

Noms

mmmm
<@416998580071563264>
My solution was googling the title and seeing if that would spit out a date (it did)
I searched that for a while üò≠
I'm actually not sure.  I would guess somewhere in the developer menu.  Just right click on the page and click inspect
Its usually at the bottom I think. I'll ask dillon
pauls busy with his real job but any idea if there is an easy way to see what year a webpge was published
Godspeed
i have a few hours it says maybe it sill stop around 4
i am making grilled chicken for dinner üò≠

Nah they‚Äôre blurry my phone didn‚Äôt like taking photos in the dark
are these photos blurry or is my vision goin
So should I send y‚Äôall a google invite for the bbq or what
Mmmm
I dont eat hot dogs but I've seen them boiled or grilled
Having an argument with Paul‚Äôs sister
How do you cook hot dogs
Reps voted against limited gas mark ups
because on the surface i dont disagree but idk what is implied
im trying to foigure out what he means about the gas one
God damn it is so fucking funny to me that people can be this stupid
My immune system should be rock solid by the end of this
Nope
Previous rez?
We aren't friends or close
Yeah I do
<@301516213773795328> just to clarify do you know this student?
We should all jump him
Creep
Ian lied or the creep?
I meassage clearly said that AC Ian gave the number though, so the dude lied
I was hoping he didn‚Äôt because I‚Äôd have to reevaluate my favorite champ faculty üòÇ
Glad he didn't do it
Ian W though
Some ras don‚Äôt get it
Like way back in the day didn‚Äôt Brandon give me your number?
Right?
And that also means they lied which is a huge red flag if I've ever seen o e
I‚Äôm guessing another ra
How did they get it
But uh
So Ian didn't share it which is good
Good

Relatable
She was just like

In the four days I worked at a daycare I picked up a cold so bad I was down for the count for two weeks
Love that
Nothing like starting the work day by getting licked in the face by a snotty toddler
It‚Äôs not that long
I havent read that one :(
You could kill Macbeth tho
That‚Äôs a bummer
Yes
Oh so you weren‚Äôt ever actually born
I mean I was also an emergency c section
Lol
Huh
I‚Äôve genuinely never heard of anyone not born at night
9:55am
When we‚Äôre you born
huh?
I was not?
Why are all babies born at night
Swimming
I can't wait to be back at the beach
Yeauhhhh‚õ±Ô∏èüåä
even though I hate water XD
i miss the beach
üòÑ

Beach day photos
Convinced I saw joe williams in rehoboth today
it is a little weird tho
no
did he message you
üëÅÔ∏è üëÑ üëÅÔ∏è
We just didn‚Äôt ‚Äúget it‚Äù I don‚Äôt think
Mostly because we didn‚Äôt know anything about covid. Nobody was vaccinated. Scary stuff
I was in love with the muffin man at idx breakfast
Not like it wasn't necessary, but it was still hell
For sure
To compare to last year
Like whiting hall breakfast and the occupancy rules and just all of it was so insane to me
Isn‚Äôt it wild to think back to?
With the whole monkey pox thing people are talking about another quarantine and you couldn‚Äôt pay me to go back to 2020 summer. And then that school year
Yeah, I was literally going insane living by myself in my empty Butler dorm room
The Whole year. Some people are missing quarantine when I‚Äôm sitting here thinking that was the worst year I‚Äôve ever experienced
Yeah everyone had a different experience for sure
Imagine being appointed head of reslife two weeks before covid tho
Yeah I'm with Max on this one. Besides, people aren't strictly good or bad and you had way more experience with him directly. I'm just hearing everything secondhand
I‚Äôm just not wanting to discount others lol
Good on the ian front
bro backed out before even getting a response
I went ahead and emailed hom asking if he did it
you havent said anything offensive if thats what your worried about lmao
Sorry I‚Äôve had a few drinks I hope I‚Äôm making sense lol
Don‚Äôt discount Collin or Thomas tho I‚Äôm not trying to say it was all good
At least he had a good impact on someone
Yeah I mean it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs a hill I‚Äôm going to die on or anything but as shitty as the 2020-2021 year was Jerome was not the bad part to me. There was so much else going on
Ian would be understanding at the very least I honestly think you should confront him. Hopefully it was a misunderstanding
Interesting. Guess I learned something new
I‚Äôm not denying there was a lot of messed up stuff with Jerome but we personally got along and Paul and I wouldn‚Äôt be together without him. As a boss? Not so much
Yeah I'm pretty sure that he isn't legally allowed to do that
Check with Ian I don‚Äôt think he would have
I honestly think that this person is lying and that Ian did not give them my phone number
The Ian thing
I think that‚Äôs messed up
He made Thomas pick up his dry cleaning
yo what

Allegedly Ian gave my number to a student who I am not interested in being contacted by
He wasn't the only one who told me bad stuff. I remember Thomas complaining about how he required RAs to check on all of their residents on a weekly basis
But when the *issue* of Paul happened he was extremely supportive
Idk what happened with Collin. A lot of shitty stuff did happen though
He would have been a great ac. He shouldn‚Äôt have started as director
He was kind of weird and eccentric but I really enjoyed him as a supervisor
He gave me his credit card to host a Minecraft server
Hey the dude literally let me buy whatever I want
Collin told me that he was terrible
https://tenor.com/view/what-sponge-bob-shocked-confused-what-the-gif-12645964
I wanted to invite him to the wedding (still in discussion lol)
I loved Jerome
are you realistically gonna deal with this guy again?
Is that a LinkedIn conversation though
makes it easier
I was planning on it I didn‚Äôt expect him to text me though üòÖ
lmao yes
thats so fucking funny
PLEASE DO THAT
I was going to text him ‚Äúthank you for not firing me over Paul we are getting married‚Äù
lol
Ugh
you materialized this
It‚Äôs weird because I had a dream I texted him last week
You think he'd be a little more self-aware...
feels illegal
Yeah isn‚Äôt it
Oh sorry
its just weird
no i know
The old director of reslife who was fired

Roomba have been sentient the whole time tho
Bet they'll add video feed
I enjoy that Amazon bought Roomba so they can mal out your house
keep it in a tank of water and its allowed
Make sure Juliana approves it
So I got <@246405757908549633> a hall pet
Oh yeah for sure
Yes social media contributed obviously but the Obama campaign ruined school food
I guess to clarify in talking specifically 2008-2016 school food changes
Well no I meant more for high schoolers.  My sister struggled a lot in late middle to high school
At least I wasn‚Äôt on it at age 8
I mean obviously things are different per person but social media wasn‚Äôt really a thing yet
I also think it's largely due to social media
I kind of think Michelle Obama contributed to eating disorders with her school food stuff
...perhaps there is. Who wants to cut in and check
Have you considered that there could be rocks in there
Ouch
Bro I found a back massager and I'm using it and is it bad that it sounds like it's grinding against rocks I'm so tense
Another friend

Stay clean an you g
I mean it‚Äôs weird at first to be an upperclassman ra but you get used to it
At leahy she was kind of my boss this year is going to be weird
Just going off jjs character he always needs to be in a position of power when it comes to women
I hope they knew each other during college or whatever
Ngl I find that a little weird
JJ getting curby?
Can't imagine she's my year
Probably senior
How old is she
Fuck
I am her ra
Jjs girlfriend is on my floor
Like i wish I was

one of the photos for an airbnb

i am not a mathmatician but these numbers seem off
People who don‚Äôt ask questions are dumb
I feel like that‚Äôs a pretty important one tho
Might but I've been asking all the questions and its weird
I would say text new head of reslife and say you need to know by Monday
Hope not bc its going to be hard to get a pcr at this point

But I‚Äôve been wrong before
I don‚Äôt think so
Still waiting to here if champ is going to require a covid test before returning to champus

This is one of two pics I took of Paul during our ill fated venture out of the country

Monkey pox is in Vermont though
As far as I‚Äôm aware there‚Äôs still only a handful of cases in Vermont
sorry I didn't read the messages above
oh thank god
No sorry it just looks like he does. The reality is he chews his hands like a dog during fireworks
Wait really?! I haven't been following it lately, has it been spreading in Burlington?
He has monkey pox
Nothing sexier than a working man‚Äôs hands ü§¢

Remember for our fall trip
So you need an app to visit canada now ü•≤
For some reason if someone suggests something I immediately hate it
Fair I mean I‚Äôm the same way about everything except media
I mean I probably shouldn't have but fomo
honestly i just trusted my mom when she said it wouldn't be good for me. i vaguely knew the plot from social media
I would just make a new Netflix profile and then delete it when I finished the episodes lol
same reason i wasn't allowed to watch 13 reasons lol
Ah
yeah my mother just freaked about any of his work
Into the wild is not apart of that collection
i was forbidden in high school
i should read him
I really like Jon Krakauer's collection if essays, the kind of stuff you like to write reminds of me of that collection, you could do something like that
idk depends how many pages it gets to
Is this for another book you are writing?
yeah but there's so much more probelmatic stuf then just that
Ah
mission trips as in trying to converting them to your religion
"chronic abandonment":
more like visiting kids and thinking you're doing good but you're really just traumatizing them
but maybe
not exactly
Like habitat for humanity and stuff?
today i finished an essay on human trafficking in orphanages but the overall thing is about volumtourism and the ethics of mission tripos
What is the thing you are writing?
no i just think its a weird banner for a website
Are you in this photo?

i just found the worst photo ever for the thing i am writing
idk my cum sock sprouted 2 legs and started walking next thing you know this sock will be at yale
maeve>cum sock any day
nooo
Well considering my parents claim me I think cum sock is more sentient so
Lol
Paul took my phone
Can you claim a cum sock as a dependent
Can I ask what the Med is
We've had a lot of problems with the dr. She's had this script for a while and when we ran out it took us like a month to fill it just bc they didn't call it in
Because they can get ina. Lot of trouble
I'm not sure
Not mine for child, Tess will talk to the pharmacy in the morning
Are they controlled substance
Call ur dr
When the pharmacy only gives you have of the pills the bottom says it has on it
So bbq on the 21st. 6 pm?
I would almost say do like roots instead to covet the scars
Wym i am already trans
Paul is dipping his pizza in Indian hot sauce
I hope you become spider man
I am sure there is a fan fiction probably
I wish Peter Parker had arachnophobia
Lmao right
Exposure therapy

Yeah that is weird
I like the subject matter but I dont like how it highlights the scars
Paul‚Äôs pizza technique

My buddy got a tiger done by him and it looks good
Not trying to sway you but I‚Äôd ask them for healed pics
Yeah true
Ah watercolor yeah it does fade faster than most because the ink is applied differently
I‚Äôm sure they do fantastic work but it‚Äôs a bit of a red flag to me that they don‚Äôt have any healed tattoos posted
Yeah I‚Äôm looking at it
I‚Äôve heard a lot of controversy about this style in the tattoo communities because it‚Äôs absolutely gorgeous but sometimes it‚Äôs gone in a year
https://instagram.com/katogreen?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=
The super fine speckled style is beautiful but it doesn‚Äôt always last. I wonder if you can get pictures of hers a few years out
Around the edges
It just gets fuzzy
I'm gonna get mine done by kato green
Oh tattoos last forever but lines don‚Äôt. Ink bleeds into your skin after a few months. It‚Äôs just part of the deal unfortunately
If done well then they will last a long time
Like sharp black lines I mean. They won‚Äôt stay that way
Find an artist with experience tattooing and have them design something you like. Depending on how they tattoo the style of the art will be different. Just don‚Äôt go for anything super sharp because it will blur with time
Top is nice but not as clean as it could be
The top one is really great
throw in some more raccoons tho
i prefer the slight asymmetry of the top one
i don't love the skull but the snakes ar enice


Nothing he feels my blood
what did you do to him
why
Trying to get me

ripe bananan

im sure it will be fine
I originally wasn't going to go but kylas mom said I should

On my way to meet kylas very catholic grandparents
Institutionalization
god the us government doesn't skimp on the big words
In 9th grade a kid was vapimg in the back of the classroom and the vape blew up in his face. He had 3rd degree burns, it blew out like 5 of his front teeth, and it left burn marks on the wall
Send this to all the vaping residents
Yes
That‚Äôs literally the same man
But this one IS Tom cruise??
Wow Tom cruise is very ugly
Okay he looks similar
I‚Äôve never actually seen a photo of Tom cruise one sec
No it‚Äôs Tom cruise
According to a reverse image search its john barrowman
Is this Tom cruise
I've also edited resource packs because of this before
Hmm, you could feasibly find a texture pack that just changes the humans normally, and apply it alongside the other pack in the right order and it would change them
The blocks and animals look great! The humanoids though are the things of nightmares
It looks like human skin stretched over a brick
I hate it
Oh god XD
Ok so anything with a humanoid face

Paul???????
I know some variations of that pack XD
Lol XD
Yo I just downloaded a new texture pack on minecraft and it looks awesome except the villagers?? What the fuck??
i could eat that

Idk XD probobly translation?
why is nothing spelled right
Not the others
That is the legit one according to the finnish embassy XD
I lied
Wait
Yeah XD
yes i found like 5
Apparnetly there are a lot like it aswell

so the problem with the job i was sort of offered is they're now telling me they need me to tutor math, science, and french
right?

Well you don‚Äôt have to tell them, I‚Äôm telling you
Tell them that it was done per channel and per role because we were trying to keep confidentiality rules per reslifes ask and also make sure new hires aren‚Äôt scared away from the role
Bruh

its a whole thing. i'm not convinced it will blow up enough that the school starts putting restrictions in but i could be wrong
that's the whole country unfortunately and it seems to be gearing up to be similar treatment of gay men as the aids epidemic. the difficulty is that yes it is effecting the LGBTQ+ community more but it is not inherently a queer disease obviously. it is also not sexually transmitted in the traditional sense, but you can get it from sexual intercourse for other reasons
I might bring my own clorox wipes and wipe everything before I use it
I've heard that for whatever reason more people lgbt community than anywhere else are getting it. Idk why but that seems to be the case in nc. There's like 80+cases here
Honestly I don‚Äôt particularly care if I get monkey pox. But people who use the gym are required to sanitize after use
Although half the students come from NYC
There‚Äôs only one case in vt I‚Äôm not super worried
wow really? I wanted to start going there too
Damn I had big plans for going to the gym consistently when it opened at Champlain but now I've heard its one of the places people have been getting monkeypox

why would i mean either of those things

I've only got like 6 days left anyway
that wasn't on me and it's not on you, so if the job is taking more than its giving id say take a break
the overworker supervisor who i initially told i was quitting said i should never worry about an employers inability to hire and keep people on staff
I feel bad for them because they're short staffed but like there's a reason so many quit
and then say you should want to do it anyway "for the kids!"
its the reason why i quit a similar job, they abuse employees
One teacher just decided not to show up I guess?
I think we've discussed this before sandi, but your place of work is a hell hole
thats really messed up
I was left in charge? When I'm the one who's been here the shortest time?
Technically I can have up to 15 but like
Idk about NC but that‚Äôs very illegal here
Anyone wanna tell me why I was placed as the only teacher for like 20 3-6 year olds

Allegedly
Isabella was there too
I liked me and Dillon cheating in the team building games
I liked camping too
Yeah I wish it had been at the end
Aw no it‚Äôs so sad stuffs falling apart
I don‚Äôt get it that was my favorite part
I hated the timing
So many people hated that
Little sad abt no camping but I guess it's for the best

Any idea what service project is <@293489371309670410>
And no opting out for returners
There is no reason that we should have more than one hour of Motivational Interviewing
They do not respect us or our time whatsoever
Ugh, I love how we told reslife about how we didn't have time to do hall prep because they held us up all day at useless presentations and they promised not to do it again and here they are fucking doing it again

How'd you get that?

that annoys me
the lunch rules for a kindergartner are the same as an 18 year old who likely has at least one job plus sports
we had relatively low obesity rates and they changed it so you could only have like 200 calories a meal (guessing) so for an 18 year old they could only give us a mini bagel
Oh yeah our school lunches were absolute shit. That's why I always took my own
i love her but it had a really bad effect on vermont schools\
michelle obama fucked the school lunch system
I think so
that was a michelle obama thing right?
food plate didnt exist yet when i was in elementary
Lol we had the food plate because they determined the food pyramid was more difficult to apply than a plate with proportions. We went over the food colors, but no posters
they used to have posters like this in school
'
Yeah exactly.  My grandma used to always say that a meal needs something green, yellow, brown, and maybe white
idk how well it has held up over the years but they used to say different colors of fruits and veggies would give you different nutrients, like eat the rainbow
eating with color therory is an actual digestive thing but not eating for chakras lmao
It's probably the yoga and crystal vibe thing considering how it says it will balance your body and energize your spirit
the vibe of the white middle aged woman with short hair who does reiki and yoga and beleives in chakras is not my fav. vibe
by chakra do they just mean rainbow
Lol üîÆ
Oh yeah for sure. I always have my name and date on mine

God that's fucked up.  I hope you and Kyla are doing alright.  I'm not surprised that the police would gloss over those facts but that doesn't mean it isn't messed up.
That's so sad. The police shouldn't have ignored her like that
Oh my gosh I'm so sorry
I'm keeping an eye out for gofundmes for funeral expenses or medical expenses for bri
Not right now, thanks though
Is there anything we can do for you or Kyla right now?  <@301516213773795328>
I‚Äôm kind of disturbed that I‚Äôm hearing this over discord and not like the news
Jesus the mayor is saying this is the worst violence in a decade
I dunno I didn't know her particularly closely but it's disturbing
The police seem to be glossing over the fact that she'd called them many times over the past year explaining that he was a danger to her and even tried to get a restraining order and they did essentially nothing. I remember her calling Kyla last October in a panic because he'd been stalking her and her girlfriend and found where the live and she needed a safe place
i heard about that in the news üò¶
Yeah. Her girlfriend was also there and has some pretty bad injuries. The ex killed himself after. Kyla was at one point roommates with that ex
What the fuck
One of kylas friends was murdered in burlington yesterday by her ex boyfriend

What would you guys answer for years of experience using a computer
I wear gloves when handling raw meat I don‚Äôt want it to touch my skin
I'd rather be burnt by bacon than touch raw chicken
Not that I can smell anymore
It stinks
Same. Raw chicken is disgusting
I hate the smell of raw meat and thr feeling and the sounds
I hate cooking bacon I burn my arms so badly from splatter
I hate cooking meat that isn't ground beef or bacon
I just made a huge bowl of falafel and am making fresh bread soon. Unless Paul wants rice more I haven‚Äôt asked
Don't burn down the house
Let me know if you need ideas
I've been wanting to give cooking meat a try for the last like 3 days but something has always come up
This is actually the most chicken I‚Äôve ever seen in one
98% bread 2% chicken
What
You should never eat sesame chicken with a fork and knife because you cut it and there‚Äôs never actually chicken
That's what I always take
Idk the dose but I took 2 pills
Advil only works for me if you take 400 mg minimum
Getting some Tylenol today. I took some advil last night but it didn't do anything
Or Tylenol I guess
Are you taking plenty of Advil to reduce the fever

I used to want one so bad.
i dont think i will ever truly be happy until i can afford a silicon mermaid tail
the girls at camp said i was kicked out for looking at them in the shower
ive come a long way but it was awful
Wtf that's wild
but the director was fired pretty soon after so I have solace in that
they callled my mom and told her || i had tried to kill myself so she came to camp under the impression that i had just attempted ||
oh so the short and long of it is my friend said he wanted to kill himself and as a supportive person who understood the sitch i told him that i understood and then i told the counselor that it was triggering to me and i felt unsafe in the situation so they removed me from my cabin and locked me alone in a room in the nurses cabin for like 14 hours and then informed me in the morning my parents were picking me up
Tea?
I always wanted to do boy scouts
and then the camp called me freshman year of college to apologize to me
i loved it until i got kicked out
I did it one year because my friend wanted me to. I hated it
At night was the best bc we sneak to the ship grave yard and do whatever we wanted
i got kicked out of girl scouts so its an all around bad vibe for me
That would be nice
I would go for 8 weeks at time and basically not see my family all summer
But echo hill was great
I was also in like 7th grade and had bad experiences telling adults about my identity so like
I only ever did one summer camp
I loved most of summer camp
summer camp is pure trauma im glad its over
Yoy could have, like, sued for that. It's assault
Maybe peeps what slides converted to digital?
ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èoutdated system?
why do I need a slide projector
i mean yeah but like, why
i guess so
Its like what are you able use
Basically can they use the things
Ohhhh
i dont either
I do not understand
Once at summer camp bunch of girls held me down and shaved both my whole goddamn legs
yes and no are the options
im questioning myself tho do i know how to use a tape recorder
What are the options
mine can lol
It's basically a mild acid that burns the hair off
I dont think video camera can take pics?
and i think slide projector is like 35 mm slides? and video camera is seperate from digital camera?
And I just googled what nair is seems like I'd give you cancer

I feel like the rest of us watch YouTube videos 24/7 especially in idx which I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen Dillon do but I could be wrong
I've only owned one apple product: my iPad pro that I use to do digital art. Apple is confusing as fuck
I was going to say he looks like an iPad baby but then I realized that‚Äôs not super accurate
What does that even mean
Dillon is the only one of us who isn‚Äôt an iPad baby

As the driver I can verify that A) it was hilarious and B) it was scary because the tire almost flew into my car

Garbanzo is the technical name
They are the same thing
What‚Äôs the difference between a chick pea and a garbanzo bean
Sorry I only sell

surprisingly worked
3 years old. He does ask for things but it's hard to tell what to give him versus what's good for him. He doesn't drink the hot water even if he's thirsty and in the hot sun because, well, warm water is weird. But he has a sensitive stomach
uhh yes?
Barring allergies obviously
Because I get it when they‚Äôre really little but if they‚Äôre old enough to start asking for stuff that goes against their parents wishes then they should get it
How old
Just spoke to his mom and she says it has to be warm or room temperature
So one of my kids' parents send him with warm water to drink because in their culture it is thought to be healthier and better for digestion than cold water. The other teachers pour it out and fill it with cold water. The kid doesn't drink it when it's warm, he does when it's cold, but it's going against the parents wishes. Thoughts?

Yeah we want to try doping
man's already donating his plasma, you want his blood too?
Take my blood
I have autism so me too
I have a butt chin so I'm definitely related to mine
Turns out I was just bad at biology
I was convinced I was adopted after high school when I did punnet squares with blood type
Boring
Oh b+
You didn't drop your type :[
Heyyyy max unrelated question but do you have a surplus
I had it backwards for some reason
<@416998580071563264> is the blood taker if it‚Äôs +
We take his
No I‚Äôm stupid
So you just are gonna take all of our blood ? Smh
O+
It‚Äôs on so much paperwork
I wrote it down on my phone just in case
You right tho
Respectfully you should probably
I have no idea what mine is
But like at you actually using it
O-
My right kidney left that chat in the womb
But yes I have one kidney I was born that way
Its been a long time but I have either AB- or AB+
For real?
XD
AB- but I only have one kidney
Just in case I need a kidney
Everyone drop their blood types
I dont know much about that. It seems like it wouldn't make any difference though; blood type is just what kind of protein is on your red blood cells
That's a thing?
How do we feel about diets specific to blood types?
Cyber
what does he do
That is Oliver charolatte
Me when Ubuntu server installer
He was cute, figured I'd keep him
I dunno,  picked him up off the highway
Who‚Äôs that weird guy on the right
That was the last one I promise
From our recent trip. My brother and his girlfriend are aggressively republican
Oh Lord 6th grade valentine's dance
Lol nah you'll be fine. I think I enjoyed it at the time but tbh I don't remember much

Did he live on campus?? I just don‚Äôt know why we‚Äôve never crossed paths and he didn‚Äôt exist until a few weeks ago it seems
jk XD
hes a scary man
i can vouch for Olivers existents
Here are some younger one of me (and my siblings amd my dad)
Paul‚Äôs talking computers with some guy named Oliver who I‚Äôm 99% sure doesn‚Äôt exist
That is fair
I do not know what to do with that
Your mom looks like a mommy blogger
This is me and my mom touring champlain .
No you didn't
Did I ever tell y‚Äôall I thought the Poconos was an island in the Caribbean until 2020
thats a mood
Did not like the people but enjoyed the shanendoa river
Younger tho obv
You look like yourself

I‚Äôll put it this way if I could remove freshman and sophomore years from my memory I‚Äôd have a quarter of the mental illness
Third worst arc is when I was problematic and started going to church because I thought that would fix it
Wallet
Ohhhh it‚Äôs big
It‚Äôs just my cell
Pfft I have the same phone case still
I like the iPad
Performative activists
Ok good
Idk why people said that for a while but I promise you it‚Äôs not so don‚Äôt feel bad
It‚Äôs not
This was before I know that was a white power hand gesture
This was right after I got dumped lmao
Second worst arc
Emo crystal timeline
I like this pic!

That‚Äôs four years ago ü•π
I think freshman and sophomore years of college were the worst timeline
Also 4 years ago

You do look baby
Lol this is from 4 years ago
fuck you know what i mean
much better. try angling your head slightly to the righ thtough
Them shoes sure are shiny
So small
I didn‚Äôt know what an overdose was in 8th grade but I just assumed I‚Äôd be doing heroin for some reason

jeezus
My stripper name was angel dust and I assumed I‚Äôd die of an overdose in my 20s
XD
This was the point in my life when I was sure I‚Äôd be a sex worker and addicted to hard drugs in my adulthood
Last one I promise

he looks uncomfortable
One of the 2 in dresses lol
wtf looks nothing like him
I was incredibly into doctor who
Fourth to the left
Omg its a theater kid

Last one I promise
Okay good
No that‚Äôs me lol

Genuine authentic 8th grade graduation
Thanks!

yes, the lighting is much better
So the outside ones are better
the bottom is my next favourite. because the smile looks best
There‚Äôs not enough braces and combat boots for it to be 8th grade
(They‚Äôre all very nice I‚Äôm just teasing)
At least in the suit pic the first one is genuinely nice
XD
No you look like a republican but it‚Äôs okay
the top one is a good angle for you
bruh those are better then anything ever taken of me XD
I look like I'm at 8th grade graduation
I can take pics of you when you get back if you want

Well hello there

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFOrJgNBng2FAOh_c3vnDqg/featured

because i have a feeling this video shot in the 60s isnt actually HD
do any of y'all know how youtube decides what is and isnt hd
i cant google anything about it yet since im not done but i will complain more when i do finish
and im 99% sure they're using the same 3D models for the monsters
without spoiling much idk if yall will play it but they ripped the exact plot out of a different game
?
so far disappointed with the game the quarry
thats a good graphic novel
how about sandy, short for sandman
You could be Sandy maybe?
i will if i need them, thanks
youre welcome to steal some of mine too
awesome
last year i def didn't do enough planning ahead
this year i have a list of event and board ideas to pull from so i don't need to come up with something and can just do it and be done with it
oh yeah
the range of skills they expect you to have
to have what?
oh yeah i mean i def did i just think its silly the range ras are expected to have
might want to add something positive about your exprience with it
id say thats good
im trying to summarize the ra role in a cover letter and here's what i got lmao "Some of these included graphic design, event planning, crisis intervention, and drug and alcohol policy enforcement"
Meta ruined everything though so now even using Instagram is a struggle
Or YouTube
She probably has other social media
No I dont have tiktok
She‚Äôs a really famous trans celebrity
You know Dylan on tiktok?
Then just be called sandi
I like being called Sandi though
Honestly As long as it‚Äôs not Loki, Levi, armin, I‚Äôve seen that more than Alex
I'm waiting for elliot pages
Elliot page lmao
But also don‚Äôt feel like you have to have the male version of your birth name
Just do straight up Sand
I‚Äôve met people named Socks, pigeon, etc
Don‚Äôt take it from a show (especially anime) and I think it‚Äôs fine
Jaidan
I have met like at least four trans Alexs
Aiden
Hayden
I‚Äôve met millions of those
Oliver or elijah
They are so many Trans miles lmao
I‚Äôve only met one trans Alex
Don't try to be original, do what you want
I am conflicted. I could change my full name to Alexander because Sandi can be short for Alexander, and my full name is already just the shortened female version of it. It would make sense. However, I feel like one in four trans guys change their name to Alexander.
Squeaky boi
Lol
Something‚Äôs up with my noctua
Taquitos
<@303228816631791627> what‚Äôs up with you and potatoes
Oh French fries don‚Äôt count though

Cheesy dill potatoes for context
Do I have potatoes or taquitos for lunch

I got a new snack today called ‚Äúmagic pop‚Äù and it has the exact taste and texture of styrofoam in all the right ways
Me: I should get a 5 pack of new glasses because it cost the same as my normal ones and I will have more color choices!
Also me: no. Same ones. Order again. Comfort in familiarity
Group nipple inspection
Also yes you should be proud of them
I decided AP classes were bullshit because you could get a 100 the entire class but fail the AP exam amd you dont get college credit
wine and cheese ‚ù§Ô∏è
But also Charlotte now that i can actually legally drink we should do a wine and cheeseboard night
Dude same never got credit for my APs
does anyone have a reel to reel tape machine
slurp

then MA and PsyD
thanks to that and my schools transfer program I am able to graduate with my BA in 2 yrs
that's wild
Our last 2 years in high school we were pretty much just at the college because we finished hs requirements
Oh yeah that's why Dillon is getting his BA after me. We both dual enrolled community college during high school
im lost
your high school offered associates degrees?>
also im still pissed about the ap credit thing champ told me that's not something they do when i enrolled\
Dillon 2020, me 2021
since when
Dillon and I both  have a degree
Chickens claimed a tree

Damn
3/13/2003 at 2:55am on a tuesday
My birthday was almost all 3s
Idk what time i was born tho lmao
Thanks!
Hap birtday
Happy birthday!
Actually I was born at 6:11 PM so it's more like 25 hours and 27 minutes.  29 minutes now
Mine doesn't end for a few more hours
Dayum
No he means the next one in minutes
19 hours and 38 minutes ago
Wait whens your birthday <@246405757908549633> ?
ayo <@246405757908549633> happy birthday check üòÑ
That way you can't just scrub it off easily
They just stamp your hand so they know you can't drink. It's like semi permanent ink or something
The only one here is 23 minimum
Oh damn
You can go to clubs at 18 here
I want drinks if that's the case because clubs are panic attack time bombs
But drink 21?
My parents want to take him clubbing this weekend for his birthday
Yeah but I still qualified as a teenager.  Now I don't
Now you must exclusively read YA
You were a young adult when you turned 18 calm down
I'm officially a young adult and I don't like it
Welcome to not being a teenager
It was yesterdayüòÖhe's 20!
Thank
Happy birthday!

These nips cost 73k imma show em around
Thanks!
Awwwh yeah I agree
Also I know he's already a stepfather, I'm saying that both now and throughout those children's lives, I'm sure he'll be an amazing stepfather
Let me be perfectly clear that, by screenshots, I mean screenshots of messages
He already is silly
And here I was thinking I would have screenshots to hold against you while you're my lead RA
Okay so <@416404018634686465> I'm slow and miss a lot of messages so late reaction: It's so cool that you're a dad!  I'm sure you'll be an amazing stepfather
Pussy
Who paid to show me this
Picture of cat instead

I just reminded myself that I have 3 coworkers in this server who do not need to know the details of where hair grows
üò™
There's no schedule yet but I think?? We are supposed to move in August 14th
i think im counting something twice then
Nine hours
can someone confirm 7 am to 4 pm is 10 hours
why do kids
Apparently one of my kids as had this in her nose all day. She just blew it out
theyre small and kids would put them in their nose
Why
although if youre making a bean pit for a child black eyed peas are a bad idea
pinto or black eyed peas then probably
It is for feels
It is staying dry
is it staying dried or am i eating it
they might have a time frame tho
We still do not have a schedule for training and idk who my ac is lol
What is your favorite dried bean  <@408779745136738324>  <@303228816631791627>
have dillon talk to his ac because i also know theyve completely changed everything im used to
Ah. I move in the 21st, so I was thinking that I could make it up there for a few days before I moved in. But I don't want to be a bother to anyone
And they‚Äôre busy 24/7 for those two weeks
It‚Äôs usually the 12th-16th but they‚Äôd probably know better
Yay!! If you let me know when then I cam try to make plans.  When do RAs move in at Champlain?
Yeah of course! I just know it‚Äôs a pain in the ass to get here so no pressure
I might have to make a trip up there for that. If I'm invited. Its okay if I'm notüòÖ
So once we all get back we‚Äôre doing an engagement bbq alright?

Interesting.
None of the three of them are
Paul does not have hairy nipples
of the sample size we have i clearly see i am bald
Wait we haven't seen Paul's,  Max's,  or abaja's yet to see who wins
Ok you win
I have discord on my phone
I took it just now
My nipples do not have hair. Take my word for it
Just out of curiousity did you have this ready to go or did you take it now

Your body,  your choice.  Sure honey
Sandi do I have permission to send my own nipple pic?
Everyone drop a nip pic
It just weird, ill probably leave if for now to see what it does
dont believe they should be in the middle
In the middle???
Or leave it. My brother and dillon both have it
I wouldn‚Äôt do that now obv since you‚Äôre healing but
If it doesn‚Äôt then uhh just pluck them?
The other one doesn't have it
Brooooo
I‚Äôm sure it will go away with time
Wacky
There‚Äôs a few of them it looks like

I had a friend in high school who had 6 inch hair growing around his nipple
Trying to take a photo
The center
Like which part
??
Bruh one of my nips has hair growing out of it
The last thing you wanna do is irritate people.  I am religious,  but I dont wanna harass people into following my faith
Yeah it's different if you had been conversing,  but just walking to up people and jumping in scares them off
I think it‚Äôs weird to approach people in stores. If they‚Äôre tabling that‚Äôs one thing but
Not if it means making people uncomfortable and less willing to go out than before
Be religious it‚Äôs none of my business but does god really want you to sell him in tjmaxx
I got invited to a lecture on the seal of god. I‚Äôm not going out anymore
üôè
Keep me in your thoughts I‚Äôm going to try and go to the store by myself
Lol
That dildo has blue hair and pronouns
i am now a palindrome
Only time I've seen it like
I just thought the marketing was funny
I have no sense of scale with that

Lmao luxury handpicked items

I've used one of those when I was younger. It is very uncomfortable
I just used a nedi pot for the first time and I‚Äôm in so much pain
The only kids i would ever would ever want would be to adopt older kids who have trouble getting adopted.  I don't want to...birth a child
Thanks
fair enough i suppose
Aww congrats
Well considering other reactions to Tess and I's relationship i kept this close to home
im not going to say im not surprised but im happy you decided to tell us
Yes
do they live with you?
5 and 10 (got pregnant at 22) both girls, yeah as a Transman I am very greatful for them
thats really cool though, ive always wanted to be a parent
how old are they?
So essentially what I am telling you is we are parents
Tess had 2 kids in her previous relationship. The guy is an abuser and a deadbeat and hasn't since them in 4 years. I am essentially their step father, and once we are married I will fully adopt them.
?
Things she made promise to tell you all before you guys would meet
I wanna meet tess too
bring tess to boys weekend
we need to meet tess
Wack
Dude asked me if I was helping my mother (referring to Tess) and then gave me a fist pump when he found out we are dating
Even the hogs staring to hate Ted curz

What did you end up deciding for first name
Is that you after legal name change

So much paper work
Yessss
Legal name change time + gender marker
48 at the moment
and needing to use adapters for the phones
but part of it is the lack of POe switches
Not nearly as bad since I started, Wednesday I'm putting a PO in for all the ethernet cords I need
so 90 monitors...
Maybe someday I'll have enough monitors to have all of my tabs up at the same time
4 isn't even enough monitor's
No
Someone has excess
If you need monitors raid 188 Cliff apartment 1
Noted üòâ
If you need 20 monitors stands go to foster 104 closet
I didn't find a monitor today but I did find speakers I need to test
Yee its always fun to cable management everything then you don't need to mess with it
I'm excited to put together my room
Lol
I ran out of cable ties...
Miles you might enjoy my cable management
Damn bro fix the cables
<@416998580071563264> Trapps??

Ah. Probably gonna be helping hire, recruit, train, help with any benefits workers have, and any complaints or punishment stuff (writeups and such)
I think it was ‚Äúhuman resource partner‚Äù
Because nah that description doesn't say shit about what you're actually going to be doing
What is the title
So I have to use my imagination I guess
Like besides the title
It doesn‚Äôt tell me what the job is though üò≠
You know how to do the typical job duties
You are able to to deal with problems and things that typically cause issues, as well as other key components of the job
I sure have knowledge of situations
I can maybe help. Very neurodivergent here, but not diagnosed autistic
Because I don‚Äôt feel like anything is actually said
‚ÄúSufficient knowledge of a field to perform most work in normal situations. The work calls for comprehension of standard situations and includes knowledge of most of the significant aspects‚Äù
Can a non autistic person tell me what this job description means

Lol he's processing
He got up mid dinner to program something

i have a hulu, i will have to check that out
sorry just had to get some work done not ignorinh
I mean if you want to watch it then you can watch using my hulu; it should be fine
Id be surprised if it wasn't on the plex already
Hulu. I have been loving it
i wanted to watch that since it came out, where are you watching it
I have been enjoying the good doctor
and dont say bones its not good for my brain to do twice in a year

Time to diagnose Tess with autism
No wonder
TESS HAD A BEAN BIN AS A CHILD
The plan was to do it when dillon and I got our own place,  but u don't know when that will beüòÖ
Ok
It depends on the hospital
Pretty sure that can't happen if you're over 18?
I wish I could but I don't have the resources to do it.  I haven't even started t because if I did then my family would probably have me instutionalized again
That's what I've been trying to tell you
Fuck that means I need to get my surgery done before I'm 23 because thats when I get cut off from my dad's insurance
Most people i has seen online were like "it costed between 10k - 15k
Oh wow
My surgery took 2 hours long than expected

Burh thank God I'm insured

i attacked him with bus bars to be percise
i did?
<@416998580071563264> Paul says you attacked him with wires at work today?
Paul leave work on time challenge
üò≤
Lmao I take it that the tie dye was never washed
yeah i agree its weird to keep it. i wonder if she just liked the fame that came with it?
No I more meant why would you keep your exes name. But it is free and easy to do during marriage and divorce so most people do
did you think the names changed automatically?
mfs are zooming to change it to past tense
That‚Äôs weird af
just like changing your name when you get married. gotta fill out papers and stuff
i like seeing that Wikipedia was updated 5 mins ago
she didn't change her last name back
How is she still a trump if they got divorced
she died. 73 yrs old
Oh
She died lol
i just saw that too
Why?
RIP IVANA TRUMP

Sometimes I think my disability is in my head then I start a new job and it‚Äôs like : oops
They got ads on the high way for public school teachers where I live lol
I‚Äôm dying
Literally since Monday
No I get it I didn't know how long you were there
But if I show up tomorrow and they‚Äôre like ‚Äúwe‚Äôll ACTUALLY we require two weeks notice‚Äù I‚Äôll probably be like :/ ‚Äúhow about one week more and then I go‚Äù
Idk if that makes sense
Like if you work for me and you tell me day four that you don‚Äôt want to work anymore, keeping you on two weeks is probably not a good idea because it‚Äôs not a good investment for me as an employer
In my opinion if it‚Äôs the first week I don‚Äôt think giving two weeks is necessary (unless they ‚Äòrequire‚Äô it) because it‚Äôs usually a probationary period anyway
Ah
I‚Äôm going to if they ask me to but I won‚Äôt necessarily offer it
Did you give 2 weeks?
Hopefully Friday is my last day
Job bad
Yes
Happy quit?
Me quit job
You‚Äôre supposed to apply if you meet 1/2 or more of the criteria is what I was always told

No but really having the door open scares me because I don‚Äôt want to see into the kitchen if I wake up at 2 am
Personally I would not want to hear that and would rather sleep peacefully

Why doesn't Paul like to sleep with thr door closed

Someone was told they weren‚Äôt allowed in the restaurant because of their cardiac alert dog
Wait what video?
oh wow
Up until today this was one of the best rated in Burlington  üòÖ
That video about a single pebble in Burlington has gone viral and they‚Äôve managed to tank the restaurants google review status

So they registered their PayPal as charlotteide@gmail.com instead of charlotte.ide@gmail.com
Okay I‚Äôve done some more research and spoken to google. Apparently although google ignores periods in emails, PayPal does not hence why they were able to create another account with my same email
As much as that sucks, that is funny
The person who hacked my PayPal changed the name to a business in Germany that provides cyber security services
Someone body has a weird sense of humor
Also. My dad caught a fishing pole while fishing

The top one

Moving the bed might be a good idea so the sun can wake me up lol, not shirt ot will fit with hanging area there
i know it's forbidden in 194 but the beds are different there so that makes sense
Oh weird

confirm you're allowed to loft before you get your heart set on that i vaguely remember some people not being allowed to
id put the bed where the desk is
Think I need to loft the bed and put the dresser and some shelves under it

You might be able to get in free with student ID but that might just be Boston students
Neat
This place is near
Ya boy can lift weights again
I'm at brigham
Second hand stores and restaurants are always a vibe tho
Depends what part of Boston you are in
I still haven't watched the show but I have the graphic novels bc Gerard way
If you're at Boston Logan, you're 11 minutes away with a $1.50 toll and 29 minutes without tolls
There's a line in the sidewalk you can follow.  I dont know where it starts though
If you're close enough, the freedom trail is self guided and takes you around a lot of interesting historical sites.
Don't get stabbed
Returning flight doesn't depart till 7
What should I do in Boston for a few hours
BABYYY
My scars are purple now lol
Idk when you are there
Why do you always go to Boston when we aren‚Äôt there

Damn again

I want to say I regret cuddling this kitten (because I'm allergic) but I don't regret it

Mmmmeeeeoooooowwwwww

Is anyone watching the new season of umbrella academy
Billy miles
True that
Lots of good nickname potential
I like that you can call Williams will or bill
I mean I use miles its more there for myself
Maybe try out both and see which one feels right?
William is nice too. That‚Äôs an old man name and I think that‚Äôs neat
Ah gotcha
No not even close
I'm guessing it's similar to Tristan?
Thats kind of what it is now except she still calls me my dead name lol
I would go with Tristan
Or Tristan (what mom was gonna name me) Miles Campbell
William (Family name) Miles Campbell
Ok debate since my mother doesn't care anymore
I'm not ok with it unless it's a 50lb bag
I like the buckets in the background

I fly
Good luck parking
I wish you luck
I'm going to Boston tomorrow

<@408779745136738324> did you try using itunes? You can also I believe use Google photos, and it will backup your phones images to the cloud like iCloud but their website for desktop is very nice to use
The phones are back thank god
im going to see if it will let me upload them toi drive im just not sure how shared folders work exactly
I have an iPhone but I know apple to windows is hell. I‚Äôve never really tried to port my photos over I‚Äôve just used iCloud
i know none of yall are apple people but do you know a simple way to get photos from a shared apple photos folder to windows pc
And I meant to use "move swap"
The word "swap" apparently reverts to an older firmware state
Yeah

Bag acquired
just looks nicer than the wiki and its not attached to a repo
think ill be moving there
gitbook might indeed be where its at for documentation and tech journals

I think I had suggested that as well
should make a boys weekend channel
I think we chose that weekend at random idk if it matters to people
if everyone can that'd be great but i dont want to inconvenience ppl
We haven‚Äôt scheduled it officially yet we can move it back a weekend if you want
Bc we are not sure if we can afford to go to Chicago anymore and of we can't we will sell our riot fest tickets and go to firefly instead which takes place during that weekend
Why
What?!
Possibility that I won't be able to make it but I will update when known

Though I would recommend treating the fish first if you can,  here are some humane ways to euthanize the fish
https://kb.rspca.org.au/knowledge-base/what-is-the-most-humane-way-to-euthanase-aquarium-fish/
Yeahhh
Sounds about right
wonderful
Is the fish unwell?
Lmao

We were allowed to do that before as regular ras
Wtf
reslife isnt letting the lead ras help pick the new acs <@301516213773795328> <@293489371309670410> ?
Right??? And all the websites say Clove oil might actually be extremely painful so decapitation then stabbing it through the brain is better? I literally cannot
Like imagine if it were considered normal to have to put down your cat or dog diy style
Oh no yeah that's so annoying that it's assumed it will be easier just cause it's a fish
Like why do I have to do it myself it sucks
It sucks that fish are the one pet that a professional can‚Äôt put down
Makes sense
The problem is more a mental issue than a technical one
I'd just google how to do it but maybe they do???
Are you going to euthanize a fish
Does pet advantage do fish euthanasia
Yeah :/
Isn't that when you dump the thing in clove oil
Is anyone willing to talk about fish euthanasia

Like you can automate proxmox but it's not as easy amd the documenting isn't as good
ah
The reason they use it because it works very well with ansible
It's great when it works
yeah i havent touch its backend but based on what happened in sys265 it seems a pain
I would use vsphere but I don't want to have to move it once I graduate
I love proxmox all of my stuff is now on it
yeah but i dont have access to my server atm but im going to redo it when i get back. still debating on whether or not to stick with proxmox or attempt vshpere on that box
Best thing to do is you can still get vshpere and make your own server

That‚Äôs v true vapes have a much higher nicotine content and if it‚Äôs not intentionally used for smoking cessation people can just end up more addicted

Vaping started for a reason, juuling wasn‚Äôt a necessary evolution imo
I think the amount of nic in a juul vs a regular vape is a bit dangerous
Agree
Also the reality is that people addicted to vaping, for the most part, will just start smoking cigarettes instead which is exactly what big tobacco wants
Not to bring up this convo again but I find it rlly interesting anyways the issue is literally big tobacco lobbying against smoking alternatives. Vaping isn't good for people but it has time and time again been proven in the short term to be a successful aid to quitting smoking cigarettes which are infinitely more harmful in the long term- definitely have issues with how juul was marketed but looking at the bigger picture big cigarette companies have been fear mongering against vaping for as long as its existed because people smoke cigarettes less. I guarantee you as soon as Marlboro owns a vape company the rhetoric will absolutely change
but once you do it it works

Charlotte is trying to justify day drinking
I would like to note the wine the smells like fuel in frame

Charlotte got wine that has legs and smells like fuel
Going off topic here, but note to self: don't skip meds for a week
ok but on that same note, (some) alcohol is made to smell fruity? i agree that their ads need to be changed, but does making something smell sweet inherently mean its for kids?
When juul came out it bought ads on cartoon channels
In my opinion, the main problem with e cigs and vapes is that they are purposefully made to smell fruity and really nice which draws in younger audiences.  The companies that sell them caught on to the fact that younger generations are taught to hate cigarettes so the good smell avoids associating with cigarettes and distracts from the health hazards at the same time.  Also, I heard a lot of people in high school talk about "a guy" at the vape shop that never carded until he got fired for it.
Because someone in the bathroom says ‚Äúbro want a hit‚Äù
Oh yeah here too. 5th and up. But just because someone offers usually
Why do you think they use them in the first place?
People use them in classrooms as early as eighth grade here
So the problem is criminals more than posters I‚Äôd say
That‚Äôs so illegal lmao
well thats a problem in itself
Most places here don't even card for them
That‚Äôs wild. You have to go to a special store to get them and you can‚Äôt even go near unless you‚Äôre 21+. People buy it illegally sure but it‚Äôs more of two kids in the bathroom passing one back and forth that gets them hooked
Maybe so, but its a huge problem here. Especially because they make the e cigs look cool
Like this?
Maybe it‚Äôs just a southern thing
I‚Äôve never seen that tbh besides saying prices
that is not advertised for kids?
The posters in gas stations, in store windows
Because of exactly what you said
It‚Äôs illegal in the us to advertise that
I‚Äôve never seen an ad for tobacco or juul or anything
The thirteen year olds who get them from high schoolers on the bus don't 
The freshmen in high school who get them from seniors because they see ads and think it's cool don't
Growing up seeing that and thinking it looks cool and smells good so it couldn't possibly be bad grooms peoe into thinking it's fine
Honestly I think most people just don‚Äôt care. Like anyone I know who smokes knows it will probably kill them and they don‚Äôt care
But the advertisement and stuff is unethical because it does not warn people of the true risks, plus they are deliberately trying to get younger generations addicted to their product. As thus, I say fuck e-cig companies
I agree with that. People have a right to fuck themselves up
yeah i agree they are advertising in a harmful way and that should be changed, but that aside if someone wants to fuck up their own lungs they should be able to
But companies like juul target young people by making the e-cigs look cool and smell good, and falsely advertise that they don't have bad effects of health, so they get young people hooked on them like they did the older generation on cigarettes and tobacco
I can't be within like 10 feet of those or cigarettes because they mess with my asthma so bad
idk as i become an angrier queer the more more i think personsonal body autonomy matters so long as it doesn't harm other people physically
Good,  those things are terrible for people's health
Like the Japanese place does ramen and Vietnamese and Thai and such
It seems like in Scandinavia Asian restaurants serve all kinds of Asian food. Which is weird to me

I guess if you‚Äôre having foreskin cancer removing it would prevent that but then we should remove all breast tissue
I know it's a religious thing but I don't think that parents should be able to make that choice based on religion alone for their babies. I could see for hygienic reasons, since it hurts less to get it done as a baby, but a child should be able to choose their own faith
It also removes thousands of nerve endings that create orgasm
but cancer?
hmm
ahhhh
No like removing it increases risk
Foreskin is fully attached until puberty
cancer?
None of the above. It can actually increase risk of infection
Ah
and religion
but mostly for hygiene
but UTI's somtimes
its just skin
no caner i dont think
But I dunno
I dont know a lot about circumcision but I've heard that the foreskin is also often removed to lower the risk of disease like uti and cancer
Nope

Officially. Idk what the reality is though. Everyone says something different and cdc has changed requirements this week
10 days after first positive test you arnt considered contagious anymore
i'm sure it is.  it is hard to make that call, but people travelling know the risks, and you already spent so much money that would be wasted when you may not even spread it.  You are taking precautions, which is good
its annoying af though

that is what i have been saying, and as long as we keep the kn95 masks on im okay

well, there is also the point that if people are travelling they know there are risks of disease
ethically
and our final destination doesn't really beleive in covid so its just the flight i am worried about etically
that's true. It would be very costly
super unethical for sure. we would be out thousands tho
are you sure you can still go? I know you have the trip planned, but it seems unethical to knowingly spread an infectious disease
yeah that sucks. really bad timing
its jsut tough because we are flying out of the country saturday and one or both of us will likely be contagious
ah
yeah pcr

Cheesemakers learn Vermont's preference the hard way. Some cheesemakers learned the hard way that Vermonters are a humorless bunch when it comes to their preference for¬†white¬†‚Äî over annatto-dyed yellow ‚Äî cheddar.Jul 8, 2019

Ôøº

https://www.burlingtonfreepress.com¬†‚Ä∫ ...

Why Vermont favors white cheddar over yellow cheddar.


I'm weaküòÇ
I used to have pet goats.  They were soo cute
Yep goat cheese is weird
Ok so I asked my uncle because he knows a lot of weird facts and We have farms near us that make goat cheese and they come in several different color tones including white, beige, light yellow and slightly green.
Everyone to their own taste I suppose haha
I mean but it doesn't taste like eggs
And it tastes very bad to me
It‚Äôs raw eggs and oil and I have a no raw meat rule
?? Why ?? Mayo is great and goes with lots of stuff
Gets its name from pepper.  Usually there's red pepper in it
I will never eat Mayo in my life sorry
Usually cheddar cheese, mayonnaise, and spices
https://thesuburbansoapbox.com/pimento-cheese-spread/
No
Yeah
Isn‚Äôt that just cream cheese and spices
Have you ever had pimento cheese?
So Americans would dye their cheeses to be more profitable to compete with British cheese
Interesting
The enzyme that makes it orange is from a type of grass that the cows have to eat
Cheddar is only orange if they dye it or it‚Äôs imported



Never
??? Sharp cheddar cheese is yellow
They dye it yellow sometimes to make it seem more expensive but that‚Äôs weird to me
I have never eaten yellow cheddar
??
No
Cheddar is yellow
Unless you get Kraft singles (which arebt legally cheese)
None of the ones you listed are yellow here tho
Even the emoji is yellow üßÄ
But there are so many yellow cheeses
No that‚Äôs just the rind. I‚Äôm thinking of French cheese
Except Muenster I think
All of them are white
Why?
That‚Äôs really strange to me
We have a lot of color cheese? White cheeses like provolone, swiss,  stuff like that and we have yellow cheeses like cheddar,  pepper jack, pimento, american
Soda and don‚Äôt ask me about the second one they‚Äôll make fun of me
Also.  Do you guys say
Soda or pop
Water fountain or bubbler
What color cheese do you have
Omg it's so good.  If you ever come to NC you need to try it
Mom says she knows it tho
I‚Äôm going to go with no
Like Ben and jerrys
Well yeah but it's like a chain
Snow cones?
Do you guys have pelican snoballs up there
Look we talked about this.  Paul and Miles aren't smart enough to figure that out on their own
Why did they have that image in the first place
Ye but I cropped out that part for comedic effect
I'm pretty sure thats a screenshot of a tumblr post where they said afterwards they posted the wrong image
I assume the joke is they put the wrong image
I dont get it

What if someone hacked your bionic nipple :(
Miles bionic nipple arc?

Every stylist we've ever been to has said so
Exact same
does your brother have the same hair type
So im just peeved about that.  Thank you for listening to my tedtalk
fair. i have zero hair training and do better than supercuts sometimes
I would go somewhere like that, bit my hair type is really difficult to work with, so if I go somewhere like greatclips or supercuts then they completely fuck up my hair
it's the same everywhere unfortunately. which is why i only go to like supercuts
if woman head according to stylist +$30
So me and my brother go to the sake hair stylist.  We have the exact same hair type, get it cut similar ways, amd it takes the same amount of time to do both of our hair.  Yet his cost $15 and mine cost $45
okay it is other apps now. they are probably trying to force me to update to 11

ill take it if you are offering
their p[arents wouldnt let them keep it??
One of my residents left this PC because they're friend gave it to them and their parents wouldn't let them keep it.

and i dont think i know everything about this
my way of like holding myself is to try and not speak on anything unless im trying to find stuff out or i think i know everything from like all the angles i can

Ywah I got class at 5:30
Going to coffee soon you don‚Äôt want to come right
I didn't mean to
I wasn't even doing anything intense üò©
Why‚Äôd you do that
I just pulled a muscle in my ass and now it hurts to walk
Autism doesn't need to be fixed; neurodivergency is okay and even a good thing.  But, like other neurodivergencies, there are some symptoms that cause the person distress.  Its just a treatment meant for good, and if it's on the level of abuse then the clinician is doing something very wrong and I'm sorry that it has a bad name
Applied behavioral analysis is used when people are distressed about or because of a behavior and want to change it.  It's not trying to "make people more normal", it's helping them change certain behaviors if they want to so that the said behavior no longer causes the person physical, mental, or social distress.
I'm not talking out of my ass either; this is what I'm going into.
I have, that's my entire class
I recommend reading some academic journals I‚Äôm definitely not talking out of my ass
I'm taking ABA now, and it 100% is not abuse in any way.  Trust me, I've been abused a lot, so I would realize it
Hmm. I‚Äôve never heard of aba that‚Äôs not destructive tbh. Like at BHS they use dog clickers for kids
Like destructive behaviors.  It should only be used ethically to help people.  It should NEVER be used in a way that could be harmful or degrading to another person. Period.
No no no no not if it's practiced how it's supposed to be.  Behavioral analysis is not a bad thing, and it should really only be used for extreme problem behaviors
Yeah
Whaaaaat
Most people consider aba child abuse
Aba is not supposed to be predatory
Ye
Woah wtf kind of aba are you guys hearing of
Are you guys in the champlain room
Ye
there is cake at ehs event??
indeed
*lore*
there is so much autism lore i do not know
These advocates, many of them childhood recipients of ABA, say that the therapy is harmful. They contend that ABA is based on a cruel premise ‚Äî of trying to make people with autism ‚Äònormal,‚Äô a goal articulated in the 1960s by psychologist Ole Ivar Lovaas, who developed ABA for autism. What they advocate for, instead, is acceptance of neurodiversity ‚Äî the idea that people with autism or, say, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or Tourette syndrome, should be respected as naturally different rather than abnormal and needing to be fixed.

‚ÄúABA has a predatory approach to parents,‚Äù says Ari Ne‚Äôeman, president of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network and a prominent leader in the neurodiversity movement. The message is that ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt work with an ABA provider, your child has no hope.‚Äù
that board was from the guy in the suit i think
Most people are trying to make it illegal
But like the same way you‚Äôd train a dog
It‚Äôs a therapy that trains autistic kids to be normal
ik the puzzle but whats aba

twitter holds the record for making the quickest and most racist AI

theres no wall between the classrooms and she is talking about spooky spagehetti
put back the AI training on twitter
let the bots free
thats true
his motivation was removing censors though which will just allow people to be extremely problematic really quick
oh wow
he said hed make it open source
yeah but now i here by choice and am being paid
good
ah elon just bought twitter
i thought you graduated
im at work
come to call
hungry
hop into call
so you put that in hosts/inventory?
{{ <variable name> }}
how do you refer to something inside a vault
to use it you just put --ask-vault-pass at the end of the cmd
im reading docs and they do not explain how you use something in a vault they just write about how to make them and i am so confused
that is how you call the var
that is the all.yaml file
what is `{{ inventory_hostname }}`
```
---
- name: configure cisco routers
  hosts: routers
  connection: ansible.netcommon.network_cli
  gather_facts: no
  vars:
    dns: "8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4"

  tasks:
   - name: configure hostname
     cisco.ios.ios_config:

   - name: configure DNS
     cisco.ios.ios_config:

do these men genuinely not wipe their ass

The room for the eSports
<@303228816631791627> do you know where eSports is

<@416998580071563264>

<@416404018634686465> Hope in chat
if you look at our github you will see what I mean
if you use the folder group_vars as the dir you should be good
will it just look for any vault in the same dir?
what da dog doin?
that is how you call it
'
It's the same as vars

group_vars/all.yaml seems to me to just be a bunch of user input
then we have inventory.txt
is our vars
group_vars/all.yaml
oh hmm
idk we did it where the vars are separate because that is what the documentation says
```txt
[linux] 
0.0.0.0 # IP Address server 0
1.1.1.1 # IP Address server 1

[linux:vars]
ansible_user=deployer
ansible_password=your-password
```
so i would not refer to it in `[linux:vars]`
inventory and vars are separate
no
so in the hosts file ok
then you just ask pass word when running the playbook
you use the vault on the groupvars
?
when you use an ansible vault, do you refer to it in the hosts file or the playbook
just hop into the shower
what are they wiping their asses with or do they not
not to be a bitch but how do 3 men go without toilet paper
ah
this friday
friday
when was the trip supposed to be
i read it as he is cancelling because he doesnt think the experience would be good without him
you can read

maybe i cant read
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
`I'm afraid that we'll have to cancel` that sounds like he is afraid of canceling it and trying to find someone to take us
idk `cancel` to means it aint happening but in class he said its not happening
Damn I wish you could have gone it‚Äôs fun
this reads as though he is trying to find someone to take us
`
I'm afraid that we'll have to cancel the second trip to the mosque. I'm sure I
could find someone to take you, but I'd rather be there myself. Once again, I'm

*"In the first age, in the first battle, when the shadows first lengthened, one stood. Burned by the embers of Armageddon, his soul blistered by the fires of Hell and tainted beyond ascension, he chose the path of perpetual torment. In his ravenous hatred he found no peace; and with boiling blood he scoured the Umbral Plains seeking vengeance against the dark lords who had wronged him. He wore the crown of the Night Sentinels, and those that tasted the bite of his sword named him‚Ä¶ the Doom Slayer"*

Champ support kids and their elitism
Damn.  I decided not to come because I had work I wanted to get done and I figured we would just be talking about crap that's way over my head that I don't understand again.

If we do a render farm we could get some game artists involved and make a render farm and see what they can make
And have all the 1080s combined
We would be able to anything that required 120 Threads or 60 cores
what would we do with the cluster?
And next semester we might use the gameshow computers to make a cluster
oh sweet
Well that might not be for long if we get some ideas I am hoping to put in some sga grants to get items for us
ill buy a walmart soddering iron
You don't want to $20 that Henry keeps in his sock

oh damn i didn't know about her
And she is an asshole to ferg
Every hates her
The dean of game studio

And in fergs defense he was getting bitched around by crispel and was in a very shit mood
Ferguson tried to yell at you to come back
last time i was there yall immediately into the back room and ferg made it out like he only wanted to speak to you and henry, and i wasn't going to watch 2 guys i don't know play sega sonic so i left
Okay that makes more sense
wave
Wabe?

Ferguson brought out some old games
Bruh

https://genius.com/Tool-the-pot-lyrics
He wants to hide
I‚Äôm listening
Why does he dig the couch apart
Other than like drugs I have no idea whats happening
Do you understand what this song is about? https://open.spotify.com/track/1lATXTBJDHwawvT1UfxWu3?si=ESxK48kiSk2fdnAbLbOPxg&utm_source=copy-link
Well folks that was enough im signing out of social media
yeah this guy i dated, peter christiana (name dropping bc he goes to UVM), said that if i broke up with him he would want to kill himself and take out as many people as possible ‚ù§Ô∏è
wait, what the fuck?
and then i called another person in the friend group out for basically wanting to shoot up the school, but IM THE ASSHOLE i guess
i think maybe she was into my bf at the time i dont really know
thats weird
she did not elaborate idk what was going on i hadnt spoken to her in a hot minute lmao
oh
emma is a bitch. she blocked me freshman year of college for ruining her life
ah
the cannula? i think it was a childrens size one because i was small
damn you owning emma
whats the mouth thing? dont they normally not have that part?
loaded
try now

probably a child endangerment issue
i literally just un privated it smh
says its private lol
embarassment of a teen
https://youtu.be/ISX-iSVnv3E
oh hard drive needs to live
wait shit that probably all still exists hang on
and then i pretended to be high because my mom was videoing it and thought it would be funny
it was entirely me thats not a normal thing but they took away the oxygen cannula and i just stopped breathing because im dumb
thats so wild bc when my mom had brain cancer they def put her out
üëÄ
they have to keep you awake for most brain surgery as well
when i woke up from anesthesia i forgot how to breathe lmao
eyes shutdown lol
hmm thats icky. usually they have to keep eye surgery patients awake because when fully asleep the eyes go <- ->
mmm wake up when not supposed to or die
i don't think so was getting a cornea  transplant
idk if it makes you feel better but you have a slightly higher changes of dying under anesthesic gas
dont you have to be awake for eye surgery?
valium. so even in the rare case where you did wake up you wouldnt really be conciously concious
my aunt woke up during eye surgery lol
they give you a medication that makes you forget everything anyway
this is good
you will be so dosed up on drugs you won't feel anything and the odds you wake up is extremely low
what if wake up during surgery
Monke spin
Monke
it most likely is
honestly maybe the harddrive is failing
Once I setup the next cloud we will have a good storage method for all photos and videos
im finally moving all my photos (in future, dont wait until there are 2000 to do this) and there are a lot of pics of my feet from when i was drunk and got attacked by insect

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaebol Interesting read
I guess I read it wrong

Weird
Oh according to this it started this week weird

He was interesting
yeah
oh that kid
yeah the guy who dropped the class
alex?
if its the alex from sys 255 yeah
not pauls friend alex?
good

I feel like we‚Äôre blaming the wrong people when it‚Äôs not a unique to Champlain issue.
But like. It‚Äôs not Cory‚Äôs fault reports disappeared. And it‚Äôs not his or anyones fault that someone chose not to report Yknow? Just society
Like if this were purely a Tom cool walkout 100% on board
Champlain doesn‚Äôt do great but I think the majority of issues are computer issues or individual issues
nvm then
28th?
isn't it taking place during finals or did I read the date wrong
I hope the walkout goes well I've heard way too many things. Champlain needs to get their shit together
Bee
wait so its like what they do for honey. Funky
https://instagram.com/champlain_solidarity?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=
I would. They won‚Äôt learn
Go for it
Debating whether I should take it to dms
Yeah like wtf
I just can't grasp how someone has the audacity to ask anyone that
That's a funny looking chicken XD
Adventures with Quinn
*him
Bro
Honestly you could report it
That‚Äôs disgusting
Last class told him and then the prof start talking and this class thats what the first thing other than hi he said to me
Wait you just told him you were trans and he asked?
What was in the context
I should not have come out but I thought he knew
We are in a quiet full classroom
Lol he's like 'i unusually insult these things so I wanna know'
And which bathroom
Goddamn just got asked whats in my pants
https://tenor.com/view/chaos-working-hard-office-work-another-day-at-theoffice-spongebob-gif-11769056

im going to do that when i have my own herd of chicks
Or at least they like it. People feed ghost peppers to their chickens to get spicy eggs
I will test this next time I'm at home
Fascinating
Chickens can‚Äôt perceive spice

Damn
Rawr xd
Damn well I dident even know what that was untill today XD
It can be helpful depending on the person
I felt like j was being electrocuted every minute or so with sertraline ü§©
This is exactly why I stay away from it, I've seen what happens to people who take it, and then forget/try not to any more
Lol

Same
Idk why but I go through phrases of being absolutely starving then when I sit to eat feeling like shit
the other day i had a protein shake with dinner and felt like i was going to hurl from being full
always fun
Me on allergy meds for depression
Yep that's the story I heard
I mean for people with gender dysphoria gender reassignment surgery is the best treatment with a whopping 98% satisfaction rate.  It has the best satisfaction rate of any treatment
i didn't even get the not being able to cry side affect
t is the best mental health med
you can't change my mind
Yeahhh fair
It‚Äôs just a no for me
Oh i was on them years
Psychology is one of the newest sciences so most of the systems are still super flawed
Most of them also do make you feel worse for like the first month or so. And it depends on the dosage. 25 mg may make you feel terrible but 50mg works.  Or 100 may be mke you feel like shit but 75 works.  It's hard to tell
Pfft love that
the only reason i was put on zoloft was to try and get me to stop being trans
It‚Äôs not for me. I‚Äôve tried so many and they all made me feel ten times worse and didn‚Äôt help the significant issues. So now I just rawdog the mental illness
Mental health medication is always trial and error.  It's a bad system but we don't have much better right now
I had heroin level withdrawl from that shit. It took away my entire junior year of hs
that shit ruined my rowing career and made my utterly miserable
I love these
Take pics and report. They won‚Äôt learn
Man and nobody took me seriously when I mentioned a pill issue
I take almost that much
fuck zoloft
Bruh people just passing around sertraline in idx like it's candy
I just heard someone say they take 200mg of sertraline
<@301516213773795328> more or less correct?
the nick story (as far as I heard it) was he would just talk to girls while they were in the bathroom. which is weird af dont get me wrong but he defiantely never raped anybody. him and brandon i guess had that issue last year
Ah
yep
The guy who got kick out of dream?
tom cook the pedo
god no as far as i am aware nick hasnt done anything besides be extremely awkward
Is this about nic?

totally changing the subject but what walkout is happening
Because it compresses the file I think
why does instagram make beautiful pngs look trashy when posted
https://tenor.com/view/patrick-star-evil-laugh-fire-flames-burning-gif-24546963
She is free
I did
take it
SEE THIS SHIT
that should work
```
from sys import platform
if platform == "linux" or platform == "linux2":
    # linux
elif platform == "darwin":
    # OS X
elif platform == "win32":
    # Windows...
```
true
just a method that detects which os
yeah maybe but i know that sarah pettit uses windows so i could just move my files to my windows drive and go from there
could do this i guess
```py
import os
def openFile():
    fileName = listbox_1.get(ACTIVE)
    os.system("start " + fileName)

```
What about subprocess.call('open videolocation')
open a video with the default application
What are you trying to do?
when `os.startfile` only works on windows üò¢
I both love and hate that

So. Can Muslims be in the military
Also nobody believed me when I said I was abusing benedryl/had an obsession with it and now look at these copycats
I need it to be happy

I was at a pharmacy in wayland and there was a notice up that you have to be 18 to buy benedryl. They‚Äôre on to us now
interesting

Nah but calories don‚Äôt really matter just don‚Äôt have it every day if you don‚Äôt want to have caloric surplus
Because it's extra good
One slice of cheesecake a day and nothing else üò§
i love cheesecake : (
Why is a slice of cheesecake from Cheesecake Factory equal to the recommended daily calorie intake
i have no doubt
It will be worth money someday

Five second rule
my keyboard is disgusting but im eating jelleybeans off it
Just hit it if it's bluetooth
And I hit/drop them 40 times a day
Mine were 50 and have lasted a year so far
That happened to my bluetooth headphones and, after looking at how high the price had gotten, decided bluetooth wasn't worth it
^
At least with wired you can jiggle it and get it to work for a little while after it breaks.  With bluetooth, if it bricks, you're done
cri
Just a gentle tug the wrong way and boom one ear is gone
I went through 3 wired headphones a month until I got Bluetooth
fuckkk these are pretty new too
Either that or the cable broke in one ear. Happened to me every few weeks
yeah
Oh is the thing pushed all the way in
no
Bluetooth?
why are my headphones only playing audio from one side
youre becoming one with the computer
I went to put on headphones and put the fucking jack in my ear what is happening

does anyone rememver what font champ uses
maybe
Send that to Lisa
yeah
<@416404018634686465>
Is this par for the course
Sorry I‚Äôve never seen snl before but isn‚Äôt it weird to joke about a terrorist attack within a week of it happening
But the image on social media is arguably dictated by americorps rules
They‚Äôre worried about their peers
Yeah
yeah, i always thought it was the students that were like that though?
Like if you‚Äôre cishet and get caught with your pants down (metaphorically) that you‚Äôll get cancelled by champ so it‚Äôs easier to avoid
oh interesting
Americorps hires most of our staff
Yeah
People worry if they‚Äôre caught in the wrong space they‚Äôll get in trouble
is this what you are talking about?
for a big picture it's social media and cancel culture
Idk for me it‚Äôs usually the pro staff. Don‚Äôt repeat this to Lisa but the standards that americorps sets for the vistas kind of makes the space bureaucratic
what do you think makes it like this? if anything
Besides Ava
So no not them. They don‚Äôt interact with the space anyway
There‚Äôs only 3 people in include tbh
but is the the wgc or just the people from include?
these are really good points
^
It‚Äôs ‚Äúwho looks the best‚Äù instead of ‚Äúwho actually is a good person ‚Äú
the worlds climate doesn't make it a welcoming space. Everyone has it out for each other in terms of wanting to just look progressive just so people wont take them out and this makes it so a space like the wgc could lead to someone not wanting to go because they don't feel progressive enough
The clam guys bury themselves but not the crabs (usually)

He was just kinda rude and weird and took his mask off when I was talking (not when he was talking, which would make some amount of sense but)
Trying to make polite conversation in the laundry room did not go well today
ah
we had just put the description as what it was doing
I would put utility
guess just slave node for now
but like for a description
just call it util
nothing i just needed it for ansible
what did you put on it?
floating machine?
it does what you put on it
like what should i label it as
whats util do?
we were talking about his power supply and how its labeled master and slave
I haven't heard that I must have missed that conversation
ferg hates the word
lol
thats dumb its literally the word
it doesn't seem right but in tech it's still okay
i just know its kind of taboo now

ok
slave would be the correct terminology

Wow
Like I don‚Äôt really go to college anymore and still got it
I mean it‚Äôs all of Vermont too
It may be because your campus and stuff is more compact. We're more spread out and spend a lot of time outside because it's ~80¬∞ every day
Oh no
we canceled our london trip

But you‚Äôre lucky. Everyone up here is extremely sick
Mm yeah. I guess everyone I know who had covid was completely asymptomatic
I haven't even heard of anyone with a cold tbh
I haven‚Äôt work a mask in weeks it‚Äôs just like champ said one thing then apparently said the opposite at the town hall
Yeah but has testing decreased as well? I know positive cases really are down but my schools numbers would be a lot higher if we were still testing kids
If it helps soothe any worries, my school got rid of the mask mandate at the end of winter break and there haven't been any reported cases of covid
So what do y‚Äôall know about the mask thing? I‚Äôve received extremely polarized information

Beautiful
actually a work of art

Like I paste all of mine into an authorized_keys file
Is that because they aren't putting them into the correct file

scp shouldn't need any generated key pairs
Its probably scps fault but its not working
Why
Fuck rsa key pairs

same i never do it anymore. and i won't wear anything else unless i cannot have sweatshirt on
can used it to swim in
Binding makes me feel like I‚Äôm dying I gave up on it
it will probably be too big for me then but thank you, I will try it

Ras think something is a secret that has been known
Tea?
Yeah just names
sally cooper?
which part
Pls crop if you use that obv
Yeah wel they said it would which is the same as you‚Äôre saying
I thought you ment that they said it the change
Yeah official champ saying mandates dropping
oh
we were told it's a secret

yes please send
ss pls?
They announced it on Facebook weeks ago
It is public
i just think lead ras are more res life than ras, and ras should control the ra server
yeah ik we arn't supposed to say anything yet but like i thought kay was about to be banned.
shit spreads like wildfire here
technically we aren't supposed to say anything because it's not public yet
idc if its me, kay just shared that new mask rules were dropping and harpber lost his shit about kay saying anything. this is a pretty small like tight knit server as well
I would rather you be in charge definitely but idk what that means anymore
i think a non lead should own the server
Idk I think every lead ra should be in charge equally
i think harper is abt to have a fucking power trip
you never had to give up ownership
at this point id agree
I think I should still be in charge
Nope never had a problem
<@408779745136738324> do you think that it is ethical for a lead ra to be in charge of the ra server?
2-1=3 because brain no read
hey <@303228816631791627> do you ever find that with xfce on a laptop, eveything is just a little to small on the screen?

DNI
gross
yup thats him
?


guess that was a good thing
he wanted to say hi at the beginning of this semester but I'm abroad so didnt
i deleted all photos of everything i did freshman year and sophomore year during the *breakdown*
yeah no I talked to him a few times
OOF
hispanic
yeah. damian rameriez
wait is he like kinda tall and lean, maybe black hair? may have been a year above me?
idk visiting i guess
hes back for a while though
he dropped out your freshman year
uh what year are they in?
if you see him on campus do not interact lol
no no no get this bish out of here
but tHe ConTrAcT means she consents any time any day
actually uncapable of giving consent at that point
oh shit yeah thats like the biggest no no
yeah its more of a form of foreplay thing imo and wouldn't count for more than one go (to me) but like still legally the consent doesnt count if the other party is unconcious or whatever
yeah that's true. Like its a written form of consent maybe but someone can still say no at any point in time.
Sexual contracts aren‚Äôt legally binding
I don‚Äôt think it is even a line
that's a real thin line there chief

"Make sure you have both male and female crabs in abundance by gathering a large number. Put your crabs in a freshwater pond and let them grow. The habitat structure of freshwater ponds is ideal for raising blue crabs, as it will support their growth, according to Science Daily."
maybe start a farm but you cant technically do that without a crabbing license

thank you

yes
hmm i wish i brought my cheasapeake book with me
You‚Äôre definitely going to want a filter. It circulates water and gets rid of waste
hmm i could also just stick some oysters in there
that is another options
I‚Äôd disagree. I‚Äôd say you want a filter with like clay balls so they it gets the poop
can you take that part out of a normal filter?
you need a filter but no filter pad
Is this a fully submerged crag
do you still need a filter for brackish
But the next time you add some you have to either get more bay water or measure it perfectly
if you do that then you wouldn't want to have a carbon filter
oh cool
oh i cant like go to the bay and take water from it?
but you still need to pay attention to it
Honestly I‚Äôd just get water from the natural habitat then measure the salinity
With brackish it kind of depends sometimes you just throw aquarium salt in
the Maryland Blue Crab
What kind haha
you have to be extremely careful with salt levels
Crab


What are you trying to house
is there anything different then setting up like a normal aquarium?
What specifically
Ye
<@303228816631791627> <@408779745136738324> do yall know anything about brackish aquariums

i hate google docs tables
Yeah it's not matte paint, it has a little natural gloss, but it's not varnished or anything so I think some glossy varnish would make it pop

Maybe it's a gamble but if it's played correctly it can be said that the increased taxes would help lower income red states and would be spun in the republicans hands even though it would be a big win for democrats

20% of republicans in the senate need to be for it and it will pass them

20% is what we need for it to happen
yeah and when that happens ill try it
thats some good shit
it will be at some point

Yeah but then she'd be like why don't I have your fucking permission
Right
Fact check that I might be wrong
You're over 18 the doctor can't disclose or talk to her without your permission from my understanding
Yeah that's  good idea
Ooo maybe
Hipaa?

what time do we have to have cars out of dorm parking lots?
skrrrt
üöó
yeah it can go it
in da kia
You should be able to be moving around 75-90 the whole drive
when i was down 2 weeks ago i was in standstill for like 30 min becuase of one lane shutting down from a fender bender
95 and those hw as rough if anything happens
i was going to start driving at 9 but i guess ill make that 8
MORE SPEED
1 hour more of moving less of traffic
that is without traffic on the map
route 2 is a nicew drive
that adds like another whole hour to the drive though
go with pauls
what time are you going down?
eh guess
yee
it's route 2
i think this is what you have?
ye
less but still is the ring around boston
but the one you showd was not hw
95 less so but ye
that is my reasoning
ye
both are hellish
mmm
or 95
the problem with that is you would have to take 495
idk i would stay on 89 as long as u can
This is how I would go

ye 9 is guten
you're cutting straight through boston
y?

nooo

Miles when going down you want to take route 9 to get into the city
i will
maybe he will? you should ask him to

i wonder if i will get to actually schedule the surgery tomorrow. probably won't but it would be nice

Dear Damir & Joe,

This semester in particular has been very difficult for me, and even though the semester is more than half way over I feel that it is in my best interest to remove myself from the security engineer position. I will gladly continue working until the end of March, and I hope that when my situation improves, I will be able to work with the security engineer team once more. However, I will need 3/23 off due to a doctors appointment. 

Respectfully,
Miles Campbell

The street lights are broken almost just got hit by a semi
Okay let‚Äôs put bets who is it
It‚Äôs a computing issue not a me issue unfortunately
I could ask my stats professor how to fix that if you want
Oh yeah extra credit does that
I figured it out but I was üßê
It‚Äôs going down because they have extra credit so they have a 102% in the class so any grade even if it‚Äôs 100% brings down their average
Yeah overall points to a grade
If you're adding max points to the assignment but not changing the points the student has, then the denominator goes up and the grade on the assignment goes down.  If you're adding points to the student's grade and their overall grade is going down, that sounds like a bug.
No pat was nice

interesting. i have very limited experience with other queer people irl especially older generations
Although the student was also queer making an in queer joke but the older queers aren‚Äôt aware of the humor
Because it‚Äôs making fun of queer people supposedly
why do they think it is problematic?
I told them about the bisexual iced coffee thing too
Yeah
about the student thing?
I told the queer studies teacher about it and he told me it was extremely problematic and I think there is a generational gap

<@416404018634686465> now this is music https://youtu.be/rRBCCVjh5Y8
i hadn't heard from him since so i assumed he killed himself
the eternal drama
Oooooooh riiiiiiiiiight...that one
remember that situation? few months ago now
the guy who wanted to build me a house and told me (in the woods) that i was the only person he would ever love
Who's Isiah again?
no i am okay now. i ate a meal today
do you need stuff?
or was i guess. i feel better today but like this is the first time i have been coherent since friday lol
i might have watched one yesterday i am very ill
maybe
long
arnt those an hour
on another update i have watched 14 episodes of supernatural today
gross
gorss\
isiah moved to burlington if anyone wanted that update üòê
Stonks
Hehe
Absolutely
Wild right?
Wow, dillon? Mad at a video game? Never could've seen that comingüôÑ
Ye
My dillon?
Dylan is getting mad at bideo gaem

toes
aww pupper
neosporin essentially causes your skin to treat the earring as a foreign object that needs to be expelled, so it tries to heal the hole instead of let new tissue form the hold, if that makes sense

mine would like swell up and get gross and i would try to disinfect them with both rubbing alcohol and neosporn bc thats what my step dad told me to do

and tbh yeah they might get infected. it's usually managable
it just makes it dry and creates microtears
lol yeahhh
thats why they always fucking got infected lol
bruh thats what ive been doing years
yeah do that
yeah my cartiledge got extremel;y infected
never buy aftercare solution from a piercer it's literally just salt water hehe just pick up some sea salt and mix it with warm water'
and dont mess with it once its in.  it'll get infected.  I did all three of these things and my ear lobe swole to the size of my thumb at least
yeah true.  make sure not to clean with rubbing alcohol.  it will dry it out and make it more susceptible to infecttion.  the piercing shop should sell aftercare solution, if not then just pick up saline solution. also, for the love of God, dont put neosporin on it
ill go with ya i was going to get second holes
some aching after
its like a small pinch at best
mine stung a little but it was mostly bc of the taper.  when I had my first hole done without the taper it didnt hurt at all
and im not trying to sound manly or whatever it really doesnt hurt, especially when you get it done by a professional (not claires lol). the pain killer probably hurt worsde
i didnt feel it. like it was just hot after
honestly
what it like w/o pain killer
so ive had my ear peried like 3 times but each time ive injected a local pain killer before hand
guys im coming up there in less than a week im so exciteddd
but also yes I highly recommend vt custom they are really great
which I kinda regretted bc it was pokey in the back and harder to clean
yeah when I got my third on my left side they put a stud in it
But I guess that was like 2015 anyway
What?? Last time I went they told me they don‚Äôt do studs ü•≤
they're also easier to clean in my experience
vt custom has pierced me with studs before but imo the rings are more comfortable/easier to heal anyways
https://media.tenor.co/videos/6a4d5177eb189383ea7088fe6cefcecb/mp4
https://studiosevenpiercing.com/
This is the place I got mine done
But most places it is included
they dont give options so ig it makes sense to include it
For me it wasn't the piercing and the jewelry were separate costs
Wow
its included in cost
Do you but them from there or is it byo?
Ah ok
it just makes healing easier and the metal is the same
I heard it's the piercers preference. My roommate usually gets her piercings with a stud first, and she only goes to professionals
maybr just new englad
generally only if they use gun
ive never been to a real piercer who does studs
That's surprising.  Most places here will only do studs (or the size equivalent for gages)
Is it a matter of like metal quality?
you can swap them later tho
round
theyd piecre you with what sandi has
Wym like I can use a fake gauge from the beginning?
surgical steel all the way

i will say they wont ppierce you with studs tho
I had to get titanium because I'm super allergic for anything with even traces of nickel
For me its not really the pain more like the sensation
Studio seven
wtf where did you go
HA mine was like 100 total (including the earrings)
yeah honestly lobes didnt cause me much pain but cartiledge was awful
I just got used to it when I got my second holes tapered
and tis like 20$ or less for lobes
go to vt custom they did all my piercings
thanks!
but i created this by just making a blanket into a round shape

let me find a pic
you mean the airline pillow?
butt pillow
odd question but im considering get my ears repeirced for wearing fake gauges, anyone got any suggesting for like how to sleep with ear rings in bc thats what detering me
nice!!!
Finally, painting just for the hell of it
i havent been ignoring anyone i promise
ive literally been dying but i am alive

idk ill ask him?
Really david didn't want the card?

From my understanding

Believe it lol it‚Äôs Vermont

CPS doesn‚Äôt have the power to arrest
The cops

According to pro staff because they called the cops racist and they didn‚Äôt want to be fired ‚ú®
Nah
Woah
did the cops get them?
Rapist, among other things
Yeah clarance bearden although everyone knows them as jaydah since they didn‚Äôt transition until dropping out
They broke into Perry, stripped naked, then ran across campus away from cops
School went into lockdown yesterday on the down low
they will have fun when they get to rowell

Allegedly why Perry is locked
Also if you notice skiffs missing windows same deal
not surprising
Bunch of stuff on campus has shut down over the last few days due to a violent previous student fyi

but Russians are in a strange limbo spot because I am going to bet their news is completely different as well all they see if that exchanges and the stock market is closed
"Russian Defense Ministry: Intelligence data show that units and servicemen of the Ukrainian army are massively leaving their positions, abandoning weapons. Positions of Ukrainian army units that laid down their arms are not subject to attacks"
they have no clue
I am watching Aljazeera and the women from the station told her taxy driver and he laughed because he thought she was joking
I want to know how people in Russia are reacting too. Like I'd be confused and pissed off if the us decided to invade a place
as well the army is not following orders and disbanding
it's crazy that Ukraine gov is telling the people to put down their guns
yeah

At least I can keep the crystals as decorative objects

Scooby is missing
idk
oh ick

No your friends who work at both
Idk I‚Äôm not saying you didn‚Äôt anything wrong I‚Äôm just wondering if that‚Äôs what tripped it up
lc is the only one paying me
Do they get paid tho since Lcdi only pays some some employees
and its not a matter of me maxing up my hours bc back when i was below 50 it was still happening
i know a lot of people work for both tho
Maybe it‚Äôs getting messed up  having two
for both jobs
yeah ever 2 weeks i submit all my hours in oracle
You‚Äôve been submitting it properly right
the grand total of missing money
Ye sort by date
trying to get all the proctering shit off
is there a way to see an order programs were installed in

Have you gotten time card approved email
Yes every time

what the fuck
also should we always get the ra thing on every pay slip?????
i think 11.90
Idk most likely less because min was 11.75
and in 2021 we made 12.55 an hour ?
I'm
i am only on the second time sheet

$404.80
champ support has not been paying this whole time
It's 7.25 here
yeah i am a level 1 john just confirmed
*12.55
Bruhhh wild
I was level 6 when I was at generator
12.65
Wait what's minimum wage there
Ye
I doubt you‚Äôre level 1
Because I joined as a level 5 tech
But I would check with John if you're level 1
ok cool my calculation is correct
If you're level 1 its 12.65
NWS HelpDesk Tech 1
For champsupport
Check what level you are

hey <@!303228816631791627> how much do we get paid at champ support

No I shouldn‚Äôt have instigated the fight but I resent that I‚Äôve been yelled at for doing nothing for weeks lol
^
This doesn't really add up because if everyone was cleaning up after themselves, then why is everyone constantly cleaning up after everyone else?
bruh why did he bring a fancy knife to school
wow


what do you mean he washed a knife wrong
No it shows I don‚Äôt respect my roommates and they told me I‚Äôm not allowed to use the kitchen anymore

Also, in regards to the picture, your features look harder.  I don't quite know how to put it, but your chin looks a little more defined but that's probably just the angle
I would say A because it seems like, given the context that he isn't paying attention, the doctor doesn't want to be their or doesn't want to pay attention.  He wishes it was impossible to follow the performance because he doesn't want to follow the performance.

It's good that you can recognize that's what it is tho so you can do a healthier alternative
just for the vibe
i would bite my arms
haha i did all of the above as a child
That's common with autism. Some bite their hands,  especially the area between the thumb and index finger,  some hit themselves,  some pick at their skin
before i knew i was autistic i would just bend my fingers and almost break them to relieve anxiety
Put on a ring or bracelet or something to fidget with. It can help with the sensory overload
dude i cannot stand the fucking feeling of my hair today and it its distressing
chronic headaches are great.  half of my paper ocnsist of spelllings like "stundent" and "sujbct"

i am being lazy don't at me
i told a bunch of little stories in where the word fuck has had its meaning change based on the context
for anyone
but three pages is alot
indeed I think it does
if it follows those requirements go for it
```
FIRST - DESCRIBE the interaction/communication in explicit and extensive detail.  Give your reader the who, the what, the where, the when... Give your reader the Text, and as much context as you can possibly cram into the description.  Also give your reader the texture - HOW did the communication take place?  Pay attention (and write about things like pauses, hesitations, vocal tone, volume, body language, etc. etc.... all of that is grist for the mill...)

SECOND - INTERPRET/ANALYZE - using all that lovely detail, tell your reader what you think the experience MEANS (and feel free to choose whether you describe its meaning from the perspective of the communicator, the audience, or both - both is better).  Don't worry about getting it entirely right... just try your hand at interpretation based on rich ethnographic detail. 
```
but its not a description work its an object
becuase its both good an bad
i was going to do shit i think
<@!416404018634686465> what story did you tell?
realy?
miles wrote his on the word fuck

Voltron is one of my favorite shows.
Oh then yeah
it's extremely gay in the way that supernatural is extremely gay in that their fan base thinks everyone is gay
Kg isn't thaaat gay, but it is implied at some points, and Shiro is cannonically gay. Amd pidge is non binary I think
By voltron I'm referring to the new voltron that's on netflix
I dont even know what voltron is besides it's extremely gay
I mean in havent even seen voltron
its really good, and it's animated by one of the animators of Voltron.  It's based on a DnD campaign

I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.

Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called "Linux", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.

There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called "Linux" distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.

It's a program that I use

Demonstrate to your residents the ill affects of the substance.  I like your thinking
Can you get me some fentnol instead of the tests?

My professor friend here in a dress shirt, tie, khakis, and bubblegum pink converse
It wouldn't be ok for, say, an Irish professor to use "colored people" in America because it is culturally insensitive.
Right
most americans would see 'colored people' as an offensive slur though, whether intentional or not
It's a cultural difference.   It's not ok if they're using it in a racist way, but i think this situation is like the difference between a cup of coffee and a cup of joe.  Neither is derogatory,  it's a cultural language thing.  It is different when people are being deliberately culturally insensitive, such as using offensive slurs
ok, thanks
in the us we have language we use and don't use, so if southerners use slurs we are def more on it
it's not really okay, its extremely bad, but as a country they have different expectations for each other
im asking a real question not like condoning anything but am genouly curious, if its ok for Irish and Sottish people, why is it different for the south?
It's a language difference
Look, Irish people are inherently rude to any non-irish people.  So are a lot of scots
which to americans is extremely racist but fairly normal phrase in UK from my understanding
Oh yeah
i think it's a language difference like poc vs colored people
Thats...not okay
the irish professors ive had were also quite racist lol
Being British doesn't make racism ok

like the standard green lady with the nose and stuff
witches are antisemetic right

that;s really racist

Yeah normally my assignments are only given once we've been told what we are doing.  Programming is really hard when you aren't given specific directions on what the professor wants so you kind of have to wait until it is officially assigned  if it happens to be available earlier.  I just end up doing them the day they are assigned or the day after
i dont do assignments before class
I'm not able to hold my mental sanity that long üôÉ
Sure but you don‚Äôt get as much out of assignments if you do them before the class because half the time the prof explains something and you realize you did it wrong
I do the same thing.  It's much more fun because you get longer segments of free time as long as you can keep your mental sanity together long enough to do all your work.
I think you do too much ahead of time

no champlain = champagne
so why would champ support be CHamplain
champlain=shamplain not CHamplain
you must emphasise the CH
thats how you say it
Black and white for a game with magic? That's such a waste of potential
"Shampsupport"
Yeah game artists get the short end of the stick.  For some reason, they only ever put one artist on a team and load the teams with programmers and designers.  I have two programmers and two designers on my team with one artist.  And they really dont explain time management.  They pretty much want you to figure it out but some people struggle with that and they dont provide support.  And agreed, getting a job is difficult in any of the fields but artists have really specific majors that make it worse.
also, and this is more for game art again, i think they set up false expectations for a job after graduation. game production, game management (businessish) and game programming can go in different directions after grad but there is less room to move in other directions with the art
the work expectation for one. like either not explaining time management or creating so much out of class assignments that students end up working all nighters (mostly game art iirc)
I'm curious what specific parts you think are toxic though.  Not that I'm disagreeing
Oh yeah there are plenty of people in the major that are really gatekeepy.  Theres stepping on toes but some of these people will stomp on your foot when making the game and just completely take over.
you can't tell me that the game major stuff isnt regularly toxic though
It isn't supposed to be competition.  It's just that some people don't communicate and decide on features without asking anyone else.  I had a guy last semester who decided that we should have a pool of water at the bottom of the level that the player had to avoid falling into.  He worked two weeks on it when we hadn't agreed on it.  The kicker is that the game took place on Mars.
this is honestly why I could never survive in game design and why there is such high drop outs. They force competition when it should be collaboration and create an intensely toxic enviorment

them
kill
I love when our artist doesn't say anything for the entire week then, right before we present our concept, makes the executive decision that our game is going to be in black and white without telling anyone

black.  its professional and elegant, and it will be a good visual contrast to your skin and hair.  though the blue would be my second choice.  it catches the eye.  the yellow might wash you out

There's probably a complicated underlying framework for enchantments that the developers did not think was necessary to implement.
Enchantments dont mix with EMC.  If you put an enchanted book in the transmutation table, regardless of the enchantments, it will register as "Enchanted Book" but will still work in crafting recipes that require a random enchanted book.
if you put enchanted tools in the copying slot of the condenser, it costs the amount of emc the item has to make another one (as usual) but the new one has no enchantments. so for 29000 emc, you produce a 24000 emc pick
What you got?

3 people in my game history class are my residents
|| also i was like beaten at a child when i wasn't able to do my hw with my dad so like that has shit to do with it yeet|||
in all honestly i probably am, but i cannot process autism fitting in with the other parts of my identity that i thought was pretty solid at this point.
mostly not in terms of strereotypes but ths has been an ongoing discussion for a while now and miles and i have a l;ot of overlapping interests and symtoms
yes
I literally cannot tell is you guys are being serious or not
(the show)
cant fight that one
... yes ...
idk you like bones
im not autistic im just entering society for the first time bc i was locked away as a child and never learn social things

no i just can sleep with socks on bc they make my foot hairs hurt
What the fuck
But he doesn‚Äôt like trains so he‚Äôs probably not autistic
Miles socks give him anxiety
A significant portion of the population has some degree of autism,  but most of them are what is widely considered  mild
You and Pail and your special schools

ok but also i litterly went to a stupid kid school how did no one catch it if i was there

You do
if i have autistm or not
Yes
lets decide once and forall
Yeah we‚Äôve done everything haha
yes\
There are better ways to help determine if you have it though,  if you are interested
Sorry autism diagnosis are $7000 or more lol nobody has that

Once you know you have autism you can diagnose other people with it so me and miles can analyze you

you shouldn't need to do this because the input takes in a string

        local_drive.replace(character, r'\\')

What language is this?
Another lab almost done


yeah
yknow?
Fair
sure but then they would test positive during the first test, isolate five days, and the following positive tests would be irrelevant
But,  then again,  people with omnicron are testing positive months after symptoms are gone
That would make more sense
and making them do a second test to begin with
yeah but like sports and such are going to have more spread than my classes with less than 10 people yknow. I dont think we can enforce guest policies anymore, but just even SUGGESTING to students to avoid people until the second test
Idk make it make sense champlain
I guess less of the student population is in clubs? As much as I don't wanna have to deal with guest policy stuff as an RA it would make more sense to me to not allow guests for the first two weeks cause that's where stuff is gonna spread IMO
Like I'm not particularly peeved about first two weeks being virtual classes I'm kinda actually happy about that but everything else being open doesn't make sense to me
Same charlotte
^^^
I don‚Äôt have classes so it‚Äôs not relevant to me I just can‚Äôt follow the logic
thats annoying
Why have online class but in person clubs
No like they‚Äôre online
wait classes are cancelled?
I would argue transmission wasn‚Äôt happening in classrooms tho doesn‚Äôt make sense to only cancel that

my balls are pretty good at sniffing out stuff
idk I can smell with a few different parts of my body
1) thats not how anatomy works and 2) what kind of soap are you using that smells worse than foot sweat
I don't smell the foot sweet because I have always had it
Okay to clarify he 1) says he can smell with his feet and 2) the soap smells worst than foot sweet
if you can't smell with your feet idk how you live

Most classes are somewhat discussion based, but even in the non humanities you‚Äôre not just sitting there starting at the prof you‚Äôre following along on the computer or whatever
My largest so far has been around 70?
LARGEST CLASS IS 20 WTF??
We don‚Äôt
?? What do you call classes where you go in and listen to professors and take notes??
The largest class is 20 and traditional lectures aren‚Äôt allowed
We don‚Äôt have those

Every person there should be an adult why separate the bathrooms
Two parts of it. ‚ÄúLectures‚Äù and also the bathrooms

I assume miles hasn‚Äôt been pissing on the floor for the last semester so
Well I suppose miles would use the men's restroom but I'm sure literally whichever bathroom he uses someone is gonna get pressed
Yeah right? There‚Äôs literally no bathroom they‚Äôre technically allowed to use in that building
They said 371 RAs piss outside
Also damn 371 bathroom situation with a trans guy and a non-binary person that's pretty baller
Yeah exactly
I guess sometimes if I don‚Äôt want to explain a vague relationship of someone I know I might say friend
I'm not mad about her name dropping me or anything I'm just wondering what their definition of friend is
I guess maybe they just said friend instead of peer or ‚Äúsomeone I know‚Äù?
That I can remember
We've never talked outside of class
Sorry this is very strange to me I figured y‚Äôall actually were
Lol I like Emi and would be friends maybe but uh we ain't there yet

Vermont it‚Äôs 5 days and you‚Äôre good
Most people test positive for months. As long as you have record of when you initially tested positive it doesn‚Äôt matter how long you test positive
Yes it will
Won't matter to champ
fucking wack
You can test positive for 6 weeks but aren‚Äôt contagious after 10 days
What the fuck am I going to do
Lol I'm still testing positive

Yeah
does that make sense?
i dont think you should be confrontational with your family but you should tell them harder professors like scudder can be some of the most incredible profs, and seeing 'scudder' on a transcript probably means more than 4.0
I'll ponder this. Might just tell them there is nothing else avaliable
what you mentally get out is more improtant than the number
i got a 4.0 fall of last year and got nothing out of those classes
sorry if this is coming off as bitchy i am exhausted but if i were you i would care more about who you spend your time studying with not the numbers that come out of it. like certain profs can push your career in a completely different direction and you might not get an A but it doesnt matter because of the experience yknow
if your family expects a 4.0 theyre not reasonable
just saying
I am an extremely good student in the easiest major at the college and was only able to acheive a 4.0 one semester when we were fully virtual and allowed to cheat
Perfection is the expectation in my family and idk how to make it not
I did it once
a 4.0 is unacheivable and youre setting yourself up for depression
who cares lol
My GPA will go down
scudder is the best ever
why would you do that
I'm dropping the course I think and going to a different one
Yeah

i mean there was a three year gap but i had to take a class my first year for ra
So 1 hour each week?
its 6 hours total over the course of 6 weeks, if it is what was told to me
free credit
I think the idea is good but I know I wouldn't have done it
So how does that work for students using all their credits?
6 weeks and credit
Or just a few nights
Is it a full course
It seems like a good idea to me tbh
Oh I helped with the capstone that designed the class
I would hate to have do a course though
No that is for new candidates
Is that our cue to reapply if we are?
Happy I am leaving the position

so, some tests that were + weren't actually, probably not a significant number though and thankfully it's better to isolate and be wrong than the other way
hey not to start controversy but a student came to us and told us his at home covid test was a false positive, and his PCR was negative. I doubt numbers will be adjusted, though

embarrased becuase i didnt notice this 12 page paper changed color in the middle

üåà
What are your conclusions
not that it means what i think it means but ive reread every essay ive written at college and every single one of them mentions gender identiy
communist
Its what separate people from the production of their own food
i regret it
the industrial revolution was a disaster
I have been wanting to learn more about the industrial revolutions but haven't gotten around to it
or how we are illegally occupying hawaii?
Like when America stole Texas from Mexico? Yeah that's not how it's remembered
Because Americans are trying to erase their wrongdoings
Tell me why I only learned the revolution over and over again
tell me why i only learned european history pls
I've been to James town
also slavery
jamestown was a thing? allegedly. i remmeber that from summer camp.
yes... but my history never covered settlers(what we should call colonizers) or anything
If this was a joe Eastman exam I would have passed
you know what i meant smh
United States didn't exist before then
White people massacred indigenous people and stole their land, as well as erased their language and cultureüôÉ
Just occurred to me I have no idea what happened in the United States before 1776

Can we just add max here so we don‚Äôt have to have two separate things

https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-225268
As well skyrim special edition is rated platinum and elder scrolls V is gold
Xfce compositor is the most reliable
and be able to play skyrim
to use gnome or to use xfce or awesomewm is the question
Have fun if you install arch
and then use the awesomewm
and not manjaro
what if i just install arch
with this week id be able to make $351.05 before taxes a week
im trying to cut down and some of the stuff ive read has said to schedule meals
and most of the time i just push it back to when we stop gaming
i dont use all the hw time
whens gaming time
genuinely asking
probably. do you really need to schedule hw and dinner?
perhaps this would work

i'll have to play with the shedule
and youd have both on the resume
much fewer champ support lab techs than lcdi employees
perhaps i should commit
well yeah
if i got the position my title would be security engineer
because every single tech student at champ has worked there
not really
it looks better
honestly why keep going at lcdi
i miss my 3060
That's what I did and now I just hang around with foster
Good to know
Just show interest in being a labtech and you will mostlikely get the position
I'm not good at interviews
Still haven't heard from leahy about rehire so maybe
In reality we're just changing out the desks
If you become a labtech then maybe
If you're stealing let me in on it
What
It's a devious lick
Bruh whats happening
<@416404018634686465>

Through bhs
Idk
tell me how i am supposed to test tho :/
too vague

I think they would bring back thr weekly testing before going remote
Ok plan
i just squatted there
What's cost like?
no issues and paul and i had hella devices
What's the internet like out there?
grow weed with pauls dad
if we do we are all moving to ludlow
God I hope we don't go remote
its for on campus students so dont stress about not getting it

What email?
it's like "we are closing early for the covid panel to 'discuss the semester.'"
that health center email is lowkey ominous
I have been able to play seriously for a long time
Idk
<@!416404018634686465> is this skyrim fanfic

Cause I won‚Äôt have much in person presence there this semester
Oh why not?
Maybe but I‚Äôm not allowed to help run it
Are you still going to wgc conciel
Idk I have lots of thoughts
So I‚Äôm trying to say conspiracies like that stem from truth that gets really really twisted
Oh ok
Ex. My cousins in urban mass can‚Äôt receive medical care first as they are some of the only people in their city who are impoverished who don‚Äôt have a refugee status
This isn't coming across the way I mean over text
I do believe racism against white people is possible, but if you look deeper into it there‚Äôs usually more involved
Amara?
Aw

I think people aren‚Äôt usually completely wrong just have the order of operations wrong
Yeah but he said they were refusing white people which I cannot believe
Covid disproportionately affects black Americans so therefore they likely would be receiving more treatment yes
Well
Cause like trace back why so many poc are living in poverty to begin with
Dude I had to listen to my step dad tell me a conspiracy about how only black people in New York can get the covid treatment
I see your point
Racism>classism>segregation (racism again)
Because I think of it like history of black America puts many black Americans at a disadvantage financially
I would flip that but I don‚Äôt disagree
Yeah
Yeah by its classiest first and then rasict imo
So the policy isn‚Äôt directly racist but creates segregation on income lines which often parallel race lines
Probably ends up being mostly white kids who attend the private schools though
The statement was like this union teachers policy is racist becuase now private kids get better education becuaer its in person
My parents should have let me drop out I don‚Äôt feel safe at school
Go hand in hand
Classism and poverty often come from institutionalized racism
Yes
Not listening by choice
After listening to fox News for 8 straight days, most of what they call racist is actually classiest

bleh
Everything bagel 2.0
idk
I still want to know how two bones got in your bagel
Solution, convert all public schools into boarding schools

Yeah bro.  We already knew you were trans
And yes I am vaxed
I don't have chicken pox
didnt he get the vax
Paul has chicken pox
i have come to accept that i am most likely autistic, but in my research they use words like suffer, and idk as someone who didn't even know they had it and it really doesn't affect me negatively this just feels weird as fuck
Now this is something I could use as an ra
Never buy a kia im fucking done I've already had to replace the whole trans before
4 days ago the car was fine

Cute
Here is one of the space spiders


if you come near me with anything like that i will light everything around\ us on fire
My first year we found brown recluse spiders in the dorm and caught them in water bottles to harass the ras
they'd burn up in the atmostphere
less spiders
(It doesn‚Äôt specifically say if the spiders died I‚Äôm making an intuitive leap)
this is partially good
No the entire crew and presumably the spiders died
they came back?
: (
Oh we have those spiders at my college

Good newsmiles
You're an adult dude, she can't tell you what to do with your body. You're competent enough to make your own decisions

double rip
I would get it graded but honeslty that might cost more than the coin
if it's a good grade
yeah you probably have around 120
rip

and that is a perfect coin if it's going to sell for that much
that's not market value
hasn't sold
cant complain
ms-65 went for around $360 but that is an almost perfect coin

not as bad as this
that is the grading scale from pcgs

Parents are super nosy and bitchy compared to students
Not saying it‚Äôs right but

Budding trees and Christmas lights
copy paste works as well
after completely watching the video i am definently using this personally, only complaint is that it doesn't do video, only mouse and keyboard
id image this is what we will be doing in sys 265
so instead of creating a pxe server and making an image you want with everything on it you are deploying packages to already existing systems?
kinda looks like ansible actaully
it's mostly for deploying software
it's what labtechs use
kinda like ad
its like ip kvm right? or more like ad?
ill have to look into it, don't have any experience with it
I have been trying to learn more about sccm
you will enjoy this video and software <@!227204721809686528> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KiOMjqykbU&ab_channel=VeronicaExplains
Sus
he's got his eyes on it

I asked him to "watch my bag"
And you but just for noticing it
And media
Tech industry
im 75% sure that litterely every character in silicon valley is autistic and i dont know if that says something about me or the tech industry or both
ok
TL only gives you files so I just save the extension
I collect magnet and Tl links
upload a file or use the magnet
yeah that would be great when i get back. as i understand it now, on your pc you go to a tracker website, save the link as a file, and then up load it to rutorrent?
I can run you through it if you want
yeah im just trying to see how this works ive not used a seedbox before
and I just use the web browser for managing rutorrent
as well sftp works in the terminal
I prefer filezilla and sftp mounting
basically what I do they just use something else
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zW-Ix0IjsmU&list=LL&index=1&ab_channel=Evoseedbox

or sftp mount the folder
then you use filezilla to transfer localy
it's all online

through the client area?
rutorrent
oh then how do you access it?
just rutorrent
haven't used electorrent
and Electorrent?
yes
are you usuing rutorrent with it?
that might be a problem
oh lol i went to the client section
seedbox is cheaper
box + plex or seedbox
Idk has some more info

https://www.usaa.com/join/start/?productId=bank-savings&akredirect=true
the payment is what you should be more over not the email
what does it say
hover over store

go to home
click pricing
Look into it. It‚Äôs a fully online bank
im not seeing this on there website?

TINY FOOD
I agree
(Not pictured are six additional owls)
I told my grandma she doesn‚Äôt have enough reflective owls


That was my favorite knife üò≠ aside from the one with the Japanese on it
All is well
Knife zero Parmesan one

Food for scale

ü•∞
Small foods
Thought so
They are little foods
Small
Are these small or regular items
Miles I can‚Äôt process the scale of the photo
it makes my eyes feel funny
Fyck off
what is that rug
<@408779745136738324>




My gran not your soup
Dementia is wild
Why does she have a dead moth in a cup as decor
The soup as arrived
Lol I'm in my parents house alone this doesn't happen often
You k ow what I meant
A not flushable turd?
thats pretty neat actually

https://images.app.goo.gl/Yqx2PfYEuAjodgKb8
üòé
i cant tell if im not looking people in the eye because thats what i do or if im doing that because im thinking about if i do that
Ph no
I guess it‚Äôs just the untreated and unadmitted mental health issues in my family
mmm yesterday i went to this place with children and this lady speads 30 mintures telling them (9 and 5) about how the cat they wanted to see died (https://www.catcolloquium.org/)
Idk dude. We just spent 15 minutes on a story about a photo and sending photos
Why print it out?
Wtf
She‚Äôs printed out every email from dad
They say that frequently
""?
They ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do presents‚Äù
Maybe they'll give you stuff
Which is so rude I know but they‚Äôre mean
My grandparents want me to come over today for the first time in years and I don‚Äôt want to go
This photo is very aggressive
So romantic

Merry Christmas
Genuine question how is Santa not considered a false idol
Viral video on my fyp of my students üòÖ
I‚Äôm too old to have tiktok
Imagine not being sick and getting your booster
But I took my 21st picture with the same damn mall santa and now my mother is happy
It‚Äôs so bad
I got booster and dyinf

Good
Btw im alive
You never know. Accidents happen
Damn shame I havent ended up in The Forest on these flights yet
10/10 resident moment
You all said that skyrim was outdated
I dont care for it
Add this one to videos that made cry
Yes
Will there be food at event?
My parents are here
I'm going to eat
dinner at 5?
The third picture ever taken of both of you
should talk to tess about it sometimes she says the same things
Date an adhd man they said
Again
He‚Äôs telling me about Russia
So like üßê
It just confuses me because the report contradicts his email and Juliana contradicts rian
I feel like the ACs and Rian just don't pay attention to us and assume its our fault
maybe? idk
<@!408779745136738324> goes the guy in shock and discredit you like keith haring?
Yeah call so@where else
lol the reason i have been scheduled for an appointment is bc the fucking surgeon left the hospital and they just found this new person who litterly has no results posted anywhere
so far no email for me
ok
Talk to me before you reply so our story is the same lol
No definitely not but I wouldn‚Äôt be shocked if they email you
do you think that i did anything wrong in regards to that situation?
lmao
WHAT FUTURE SITUATIONS AM I DEALING WITH
TOMORROW IS MY LAST DAY
Also RIAN
I did. Lmao. I feel bad for pat in case he has to argue that I misheard him
dude fuck it just send what you just told me to rian if you havent alreadu
I even told her that this wasn‚Äôt technically a move out
I suggested to her that if she was set on not coming back to 371 she should take most of her stuff when she leaves for break. That is not the same as moving out.
I didn‚Äôt put that in the report because I guess I assumed pat wrote one. So bad assumption on my part there sure but üßê
and be like i did reach out to pat
since you are leaving i would honestly be like "as you will see in my ir i did not advis her to move it "
‚ÄúYou should have reached out to pro staff‚Äù I did
idk
Juliana also said I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong, just that it was feedback. But rians feedback is irrelevant because it isn‚Äôt accurate?
I did! He must not have read the IR because I specifically said those things
And also like‚Ä¶ I reached out to Juliana and they said he was ‚Äúproviding feedback‚Äù lmao I did nothing wrong
i think you should tell him that
I didn‚Äôt stop her, doesn‚Äôt mean I told her to
I filed an ir about the situation last night, explained that even though she was moving her stuff it didn‚Äôt mean she had a new room, etc, and just got an email from rian saying ‚Äúyou shouldn‚Äôt have advised her to move that‚Äôs not your job‚Äù
and why
who?
But yes ping does nothing.
I‚Äôm going to kill someone
i just feel like i do so much more than her
Hm

This just fucking pissed me off
Did he atleast show you the ifixit kit he always carries
Miles and his cable collection

<@!416404018634686465> Dinner at 5?
Snow = warm because it's a good insulator

<@408779745136738324> are you going to change your name when you are mo longer an ra
Someone I hate got top surgery and his nipple fell off and i think he got was he deserves
When you find out one of your best friends from high school finally got top surgery, but you found out about it from someone else‚Äôs social media not his because you don‚Äôt talk anymore.
home page seems like the vid selection is unbearable shit
it looks like a torrent site meets shit app store
looks like one
youtube alterative
https://odysee.com/
not a torrent site lol
what torrent site is this?


where am i
really the solution is to learn latex
ill check it out
oh apache maintains a fork now, didn't know that
more like modern office
a little nice than libre's ui
openoffice is deprecated I thought
openoffice
i love me some win7 graphics
if I can get cinnamon running on it ill try basically everything
id have to learn dnf right?
im open to it I just quite understand why fedora
why
try fedora over debian
>:(
Cinnamon roll
also have to figure out how to get cinnamon installed on it
cause debian
might try out debian for fun if I can get the drivers figured out
no clue what's going on
I did that, problem persists
re-install the whole os
likely not but the paranoia sets in
wondering if there's some issue with my hardware
never had any issue on any of the shitbox machines ive run this exact setup on
but yeah idk what it is
chromium is evil
real heads pick their os entirely to avoid a single line of code from red hat
hmm firefox has never given me a problem but I have mostly used chromium
that's fair, im just memeing
I want to believe it's some memory leak in firefox but in reality I have no clue
yeah because I want the slightest hope of stability
anyway, for some reason my computer keeps completely freezing every once in a while I think im going to scream
mans uses manjaro and not arch and still flexes
it works the best with manjaro
fair enough
I only use libre
libreoffice write is fine but surely there's something nicer
speaking of foss, you have any recs for a word processor that doesn't suck shit through a tube
it's FOSS, we could
we need to give temple networking

@here please come get hot cocoa we made too much
oh lol
No you kinda have to hold it sideways and pee on the blue end

do you need to take anything off of it when you take it out of the packaging?
No you need to shotgun 3 cokes before doing it
ill try again later
ive still got the other one
that would make sense
Miles respectfully I think you peed on the wrong end

you tell me i think i did it wrong
Did you find out
Wait miles were you pregnant

so hobbit stole from journey to the west
they have the same narrative, motifs, and conventions
yes
no
hobbit == monkey and the monk

Also you guys know any history?

Miles this is what I was talking about yesterday. First thing in my reddit feed
;)
i cant work at champ until yall are gone
i wish
You are faculty
You
oh i dont know who our faculty sponsor is
<@408779745136738324> so how it works to get the email. Thr factually/staff sponsor has to reach out and out in a request through the ticket system then you will get the email.
I mean like ask the heads then tell me
To whom
Okay can you try to reach out soon
Just yelled to <@!246405757908549633> and was ignored smh
What‚Äôs the process tho
Maybe birchwood dream
Potentially I‚Äôd have to check with club heads first
<@408779745136738324>
Do you want dream@champlain.edu?
Hey champ support kids do you know how clubs having my mail accounts works
that you?

i plead the 5th \
<@416404018634686465> does tess do this to you?
Mmmmmm
Me and paul decimating the sesame chicken after I get out of hospital
Download the first and then run it and see if it prompts you
Any game just look at the games steam page and it will say dirextX version
What kind of games
You should most games need direct x 12
I dont think I have any games with ti
Microsoft's
I have found the most reliable way is to get it from a steam game
What website did you get it from
Really
Updates didn't fix it
This is pretty lame
I want to go home smh
Lmk how that works out
Update everything that might be it
Yeah there were sime
Check again because it may have a few things
Is it all updated?
Before
I've updated
Have you gone to windows updates?

And send me an ss of that
Go to the windows run and type dxdiag
Hmm interesting
I got it from the website
When you installed the steam game did it make you install directx12
Still gives me the error
Yes you need to reboot after install for most things that are graphics related
Well I did and it still gives me the error but im going to reboot
Or download it from the website
Then you should be good I forgot about that
Oh download any game on steam that needs directx12 and then install it from there

Then turn off as much as you can just run time spy
Downloading
Them get the demo
https://store.steampowered.com/app/223850/3DMark/


3Dmark?
Don't see it
It's on steam and you can run the free time spy
Get 3d mark before anything else and see what you score
Welcome to have more than 2 cores
Holy shit this thing is fast
There was a miscommunication
Wow seriously
Sorry Dillon I thought Charlotte was going to message you
I had to dip but miles and Paul might be there
Dinner?
hes finally on the phone
I am almost there
he's hiding on the stairs and just yelled at me when i asked if he needed help
I am coming down so I can see who it is because I might laugh at them if I know them
Just call cps anyway
he had some sort of hat
Naw I am with abijah
idk maybe
Does he have an old man hat on
hes def a cncs kid but he;s a commuter?
Honestly he probably shouldn't have access
it's not working
and he walked into wgc and started yelling "HELLO" instead of coming in and talking to me
^
He should have key csrd
Chanp support won't let him in
which doesnt make sense
i offered to call champ support and then i offered to call cps and he said no he doesnt want to walk there
Just let him suffer then
Which kid
that kid in skiff is back trying to get into the lab and hes being really rude to me
Most of them
Were they normal?
No not echos. I was supposed to get an echo but could only afford ekg
This happens more than it should I‚Äôve had dozens of echos
Miles makes a point
But wut if u dont
No I‚Äôll live
Do you think you should go to hospital or like make a emergency appointment with the health center?
Which is inconvenient because I have so much to do today
I‚Äôm having severe chest pain


or that
shit tab

I‚Äôm stuck in game
How do I get back to discord and unmute myself

Ahh yes ye ol remove screw turn off bug
God my back hurts
paul was joking apparently lol
?
there is a loose screw in the laptop so that it doesnt turn off?
that doesnt make sense
what
That is so your computer won't turn off
Paul did the screwing i just looked at held the bat
im being v serious
i can hear it shaking around in there lmao
<@!416404018634686465> <@!227204721809686528> so who forgot a screw in the laptop

On my way
Hang on
We‚Äôve got to park the car
Sure
Dinner 5:15ish?
homosexual even
Double gay
Gay
No lmao
Did you record it?
Just witnessed my first high school fight
After we go to resource
Okay I can fix that tonight
i think the battery is loose
yes
Is your computer fully up to date?
no im not dumb
Smh install Linux
it is entirely windows antivirus
What is using that much cpu?
chugging along poorly

All I did then was allow Java to talk on the lan
but you had to do a bunch of weird shit because lan wasnt working
Maybe then we lived together so it was useless
did you not install it for minecraft
Idk about Hamachi I used to use it but it always caused me problems
Why would vpn stuff be on here otherwise
I can open the laptop later I have my kit and the grounding strap
Going to find it department
When did we ever use Hamachi?
Need some tools from pual or champ support though
I'm sure pual could as well but I can open it if you want
Yeah the battery might be partially disconnected
It‚Äôs done it 5 times in the last 10 minutes
Ah
My laptop shuts down without warning
Are these 2 different things youre talking about?
which would actually make a lot of sense
also, acer is saying the issue is probably a battery being loose issue
Why
paul made me uninstall that
Get the free one and run it
https://www.malwarebytes.com/
That doesn't look right
paul did you do something to my laptop
What the fuck is that

umm whos she
My laptop is being fucky again
my capstone is student teaching
For capstone teach me and Paul to spell
Are teaching the child's about Holden?

Fettuccini ?
What the fuck is fennachinne
They got fennachinne at idx
No u do that
Get me a m.2
I am the only one at champsupport right now...

Skiff computer lab
no i just am writing something up for wgc and said it is accross from 'xxxx'
So you want room #?
why?
yeah
so like the cyber lab
that is at least the domain name
cyber.local
what is the skiff classroom called. like does it have a name
they already want to charge for break housing (I think) because they can't fill the dorm
yes true but then i would be able to digitally see who opened which box at what time and how many times
the school don't got cash like that
$$$
if i were them i would make the box key card access
and it would most likely be possible to max it out and then go back to zero
im googling and not finding such a device
as well we could just fuck it be opening and closing it hundreds of times
because if its keyed into 50 times a semester but only one report filed...
or like once a semester
and keep track of how many there were like last week and then add them to the current week
someone then has to check them
i dont see that a manual counter would cost that much
i mean like it is possible to do it but idk about if they have the $$$
no way we have that type of money
yeah
this was just a thought i had, do you guys think the new lockboxes could have some sort of digital/manual counter because ras havent been charging for lockouts

üòç

I found the perfect equation when graphed
I just said it isn't professional
I didn't say that

Im not okay anymore Paul won‚Äôt get matching boogie rings üòî
I agree tho glad ur okay in the not covid way

I don‚Äôt have covid. Thank god
On my way to IDX
Push back to 5:15 and you got a deal

<@!416404018634686465> vc
yeah the pool needs to ping you and the school doesn't allow icmp inbound
i connected it to my phone's hotspot and it is working!
make the switches lan different from the school and see if that works
still same error so its not the switch
also Charolate what do we get if youre wrong?
im going to try going directly into the wall and take the switch out of the equation
the problem might be if the pool needs to ping you they won't be able to unless it's a reverse proxy
I got it working last year but that might be because I subnet my network
Guys if I‚Äôm right about this game you owe me bank
either its champ or i need to enable ipv6

You were probably just engrossed in taking magnets apart and looked at them when they happened to look at you.
I mean I glanced over at them once because I was curious what they were talking about but thats it
?
:/
well im sorry if I did but like i stare a lot
shes not telling me who specifically glared but she was looking at me...
did they like write complaints about us?
i know they did talk about it but i wasnt really listening
are they asking about any of use specifically or like all of us?
i glare at everything and don't remember them talking about drugs?
They were talking about drugs?
i dont remember this but i guess its possible
no like apparently we glared at people who were talking about drugs
No?  I wasn't even paying attention to them.  I wanted to knit but got distracted by the fridge
like with the poetry?

you have to be really careful with your back because its really easy to really fuck stuff up
a little bit ago so it hasn't kicked in
<@!227204721809686528> have you taken advil?
According to the song
Pussy
As well as his **
my neck is fine right now
His neck too
just because one spot felt like a needle poking it but that was because of the chair I was sitting in
and did it start suddenly?
His back
where does it hurt?
Is bad
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know a back could hurt this badly‚Äù
and it is starting to feel better
that is hyperbolic language get reported kid
"Ugh my back hurts so much" "Yeah I didn't think a back could hurt this badly"
Paul you said you felt like you were dying
so youcan die in peace
im not going to touch you im going to guard you

I‚Äôm 99% sure you can block or remove people
I mean like your username? Because you can make it so they can‚Äôt see what you listen to
peeps who really fucked me up still follow me
no like other users from being able to see my profile
Like artists?
i really wish Spotify had the option to block people
Trigger warning jj in idx
No

When do we plan for dinner?
For context I was walking to the actual entrance
<@227204721809686528> I watched Katie and Quinn stand in front of the side target door that says please use the other door for a good 5-10 seconds before realizing it wasn't an entrance
ok
I would just look out for the other one just because it's low profile
yes
oh so the other one should be fine too?
it is saying that just because before 2019 they didn't come with the amd bracket but now they do so you should be all set
one minute
Paul it says the NH-U12S may need an adapter too

Sounds good to me
At 12?
Brunch?
im reading a study for one of my cor classes about how all the Urban Farming projects that claim to address fodd insecurity mostly sell their produce to high-end restaurants and it is unaffordable to food insecure households
Not sure what you mean by urban farming but everywhere is becoming urban so like hydroponics are going to be more popular
hot take Urban Farming is a scam

its the best photo from that day lol
why do they keep using my picture
But it‚Äôs not really locked if I can put stuff on without fp
it's for security samsung has locked ssd's and now they came out with one with biometrics

Okay I understand what he is doing. He‚Äôs putting the files onto the computer via the ssd then copying them back onto the ssd. Why the finger print at that point tho. I am lost
Like it‚Äôs not transferring the files to the ssd you plug it into your computer scan ya finger and put the files on the computer
Why would essentially the ssd to usb converter need the fingerprint thing
Yeah but my computer restarted and is having an aneurysm so it won't stay that way for long
You‚Äôre still in game
My fucking computer overheated somehow so there goes all my progress tonight

So my mom invited me and Paul to my family‚Äôs thanksgiving (which I hadn‚Äôt asked you about yet Paul because I wanted to confirm my grandma was cool with it) and so I text her and she basically says no he can‚Äôt come and also you‚Äôre no longer invited
what are they doing
What happened this time?
My family sucks dude
i am now in season 4
Me trying to get the toe jam

creepy

It'd back on for me
It should be back on
When are you going to turn the plex server back on?
will be over in one minute
I'm heading to IDX
if you can ping with names and not just ip's that means *you're in*
because it is in AD at that point
fuck
then you're having a password problem
yes
ping fw01-miles.miles.local works
but i cant log in with miles.campbell-cmd
yes and pinging with like fw01-miles works
and other devices?
like you can ping the internet?
send me your pointers on AD

yes
and that adapter is turned on?

send me all the info from web01
10.0.5.4
0.4 aka web01
Which one isn't wtalking with ad?
ok
give me a minute
one sec I have confused myself now
wait
they're the smae thing
fs01 is .8 and web01 is .4

MILES your IPv4 is 5.8 and in AD it is 5.4
this

no

ipconfig?
of what?
send me and ss from the core server
im confused, i don't think the box is actually on the domain. but i don't why it isn't
because windows core is talking with ad
what is the problem?
you mean in the assignment?
this is on ad
? the web01 isn't a linux box?

manial
and is the centOS machine DHCP or manual
and in ad you have a pointer along with a ptr
it didn't reset
if the dns address and the search domain is correct it should be good
did it reset it?
yes
did you restart the machine?
didn't ask for any creds though
i added the domain in nmtui
yeah
a centOS box?
which one
also i forgot how to add a linux box to the domain. it has records and all that but i can't login with my admin account
yes

Dinner @5?
The person whose argument I was reading was saying that adoption in general is kidnapping lol
so can dr phil
Also those wilderness therapy programs can kidnap you legally
bringing kids back when they run away from their parents is legalized like non prison captivity
Like reunification is the goal but not always practical
yeah
I mean it really depends why they‚Äôre in foster care
depends on if the parents are dead or not
Just saw an extremely online take: adopting from foster care is legalized kidnapping

Miles do you need help
What‚Äôs going on folks
But I guess not actually
oh fuck
Yeah. You‚Äôre still in game

<@246405757908549633> <@416404018634686465> games at 9:45
We‚Äôre doing the forest so over discord at like 9:30 probably?
Gay night
Also when and where is game night?
I‚Äôm sorry
Ah I was confused
We said we were going out to eat üòÖ
Soo when are we eating?
Or board games?  Regardless, yes
Are you talking the forest?
I have been convinced to eat else6
<@246405757908549633> are you on for game night
I do
Miles you and Dillon play game tonight
No you
Gay
Not really, sorry
Do you want to go with us to Hana
Snack
Bunny at bader

Or if you want Hana we are potentially going there but idk how Paul is feeling
Ah I see
I will know what i am doing as soon as I see Paul
I'm free for dinner if you just want to go to IDX miles
Oh ok
Lauren wants to go out to eat idk what the plan is
Waiting for pail
dinner anyone?
Ok
You me Paul and Dillon
Can we play game
Duty
<@!416404018634686465> <@!246405757908549633> busy tonight?
Yeah ill talk to her. Thanks
Ah
Your other COR prof
Whos Cindy
But moral of the story it‚Äôs doable and safe
I got on the topic of lgbt issues in Jordan and she said her daughter is gay and Cindy would be happy to talk a bit about what that looked like. And if students in the class have a different name on their passports they might want to chat with her sooner rather than later just to figure out what that‚Äôs going to look like.
D :
And I have a meeting I forgot about
Im actually probably not going to do sushi not seeing anything I‚Äôm dying for
Sorry I thought you said you were going to eat at 7
you just asked me why i had it put at 7
The sex ed event is at 7
im so confused
It has always been planned at 7
????
No 7
is it 7:30?
We have the event at 7?

<@416404018634686465> breakfast
also where in the legal code is it against the law, I've read parts, and "Sado-mascochistic abuse" is only illegal if it's in public
looking to become fettered, bound or otherwise physically restrained
@here if anyone is awake, you wanna come test a game at Juniper?
What about your flagellation and torture
and inherently political
my boners are always artistic
UNLESS your boner has serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value,
(5) "Sado-masochistic abuse" means flagellation or torture by or upon a person clad in undergarments, a mask or bizarre costume, or the condition of being fettered, bound or otherwise physically restrained on the part of one so clothed.
But not technically illegal
Bdsm is considered inherently sexual even if the people never have penetrative sex, so it is indecent
Okay wait let me rephrase
Also having a boner in public is illegal
Second off: if a woman is wearing a shirt that only covers the top half of her boob, it is illegal. However, being fully nude is not
Why
Wtf?
First off: bdsm is illegal
Oh?
I have read most of the sexual harassment/lewd content laws in Vermont and I have returned with interesting information
<@!416404018634686465>

<@!416404018634686465>  do a translation from Arabic to English on the authors name that is another part you can add to the essay - Paul
She is almost invisible and I think that's because it's for her own safety
No clue still haven't dug through enough Arabic to find that answer
is the author queer?
This is a good read about how to country wants to protect its 'morals and values'
http://www.kapitalis.com/anbaa-tounes/2018/03/02/%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%86%D8%B3-%D8%AA%D9%85%D9%86%D8%B9-%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%B6-%D9%81%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%85-%D8%A5%D9%8A%D8%B7%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A-%D9%8A%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%AF%D8%AB-%D8%B9%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AB/

<@416404018634686465>
Party is just a term because you could count 2 people going hard ad a party
Common source defines party to then usually
Party idk but it‚Äôs more about # or alcohol bottles
By college definition what counts as a party?
not to sound like i live in a hole but i've never been to a party so like other than movies I really don't know what they look like but i guess that was one
i mean there were 9 peeps there
Good job miles fucking get em

You busting my kids?
MILES <@!416404018634686465>
do you like this quote from one of my first essays at college
The aesthetically pleasing nature of this new laptop has all the functionality and charm of any computer, but what does the lack of decoration say about me as a person? The fact that I felt it necessary to list off the specs of this computer off labels me as analytical. What it says culturally however is that I want people to think I know what I‚Äôm talking about. I want people to believe I know a lot about computers but in reality I‚Äôm just sitting here reading off the internal components from a sticker situated under my right wrist.
I think it's good
im gonna wait another 15 minutes before sending it so speak now or forever hold yall peace
ye
Ra Staff meetings
is that meant to say staff meetings
thats okay
"Brianna has been seen at staff meeting without having her mask securely on her face. She will have it secured for a few minutes then go straight back to having her whole nose and mouth just about out of the mask." My Grammer isn't good
yes
I will send it in one min
Good can you add a quote from me
also I am sending the email about Brianna tonight
And they didn't get out in under 2 min
At least that's what residents said

It was a fire drill I think
I saw you and julie chattin up cps
<@!246405757908549633> wus poppin at pearl earlier

I was trying to pick up litter and this is weed
There has been an incident
I am heading to dinner now
aye
@everyone 6:00?
I‚Äôll be back by 5:45
When do you guys want to get dinner?
Pail said he‚Äôd transfer if I died

Dinner @4:30 ?

Ah
For the LinkedIn thing
?
Walk to garden center
Ah
It's because I haven't touched the account for years
They didn't need me to put in my ID?
Now I am going to email my career coach and ask what I should do because there is no way in hell I am giving linkedin my ss or passport
Um I don‚Äôt know
The fuck am I supposed to do linkedin rejected my ID and says I don't own my account
@here lunch?
Shout out to the bartender at Applebee‚Äôs who asked us if we were college professors then talked about how much he hated college students
I should get ready for staff meeting
Ah
I went to Applebee‚Äôs
I‚Äôm drinking coffee naked with the cat who‚Äôs also naked
Where are you?
Miss you guys ü•≤
I think the grammar is fine
Got it, feel free to make any edits (I know the grammar is not the best lol)
Sorry if I my messages seem disjointed.  I'm doing math homework so my brain is kind of fried
You know what, you can list my name on the email.  I feel like if they see that there are multiple people concerned about it, they'll be more likely to do something
if you don't feel super strongly about it that's alright
I sent it to you it's totally up to you
If you want me to review it I will though
I don't really care I was just making a joke
Dillon do you want to actually be listed on the email?
Yeah I'll do that
Word
Yeah I‚Äôd either do just rian and Ezra or everyone
Cause they're my AC? Maybe I'll j keep it to Rian and Ezra
Yeah but why Juliana
Paul would know since Ezra is his AC
Hill is central right? so her AC would be Ezra?
tru
Of course the other ACs would probably get told anyways
That's probably a good idea since its what we're supposed to do
I dunno if I should just keep it to folks more closely involved or if I should go ahead and send it to Ian and Pat as well
wanna be added? I'll send it to you dil
Aww I'm not included in the anti-Brianna campaign
Also do you want to add Ian and pat? Or was it intentionally left out
Throw my name on there too
thnx

lol
I can't find the photos
You should add that in the photos her residents are unmasked so she def isn‚Äôt enforcing policy
It's not long, I kept it concise because these bitches busy
I emailed you guys my draft, feel free to look it over and if you want to actually be included on/in it feel free to edit
Yes I can try
Also can someone re-send me that pic of her with a resident w mask down
<@!416404018634686465> <@!227204721809686528> <@!408779745136738324> I'm using studio time (that im literally in w brianna rn) to write email about concerns about her mask wearing. I just wanted to confirm that her AC is Ezra, correct? I'm thinking about sending it to my AC (Juliana), Rian, and her AC
I guess I assumed Paul would be with you if you were at IDX so I thought you weren't there since you're talking on discord.  I'm on my way
I am here and have eaten i thought we ware going at 4 45
So are we going to dinner?

Why didn't that embed??

## Summary

Firstly I checked to make sure my PFServer was working properly, and it was not! It had an incorrect LAN IP address, so I fixed that. Then I cabled the Windows Server 2019 (Win-19). Then I configured the network settings like so:
* IP Address:  10.0.5.5
* Netmask: 255.255.255.0
* Gateway 10.0.5.2 (Make sure fw01 is running).
* DNS 10.0.5.2

Then I changed the time zone and the hostname of the VM, rebooted. Then I installed Active Domain Services (located in Server Manager). Then I promoted the server to be the main domain controller. Then I added a DNS record (in server manager) by going to DNS --> DNS Manager --> Forward Lookup Zones --> MY_USERNAME --> (right click) MY_USERNAME --> New Host, and then entering the appropriate information. Then I went to Reverse Lookup Zones --> New Zone,  and entered the appropriate information. Then I went to the firewall properties un-checked and then re-checked the Update associated PTR record. 

Then I created a new Named Domain User by going AD DS --> (right click) the server name --> Active Directory Users and Computers --> (right click) Users --> New --> User, and then I entered in the appropriate information. Then I went back the the user list --> (right click) appropriate user --> Add to a group, and then entered the appropriate information. 

Then I prepared my Workstation to Join the domain by going to the Control Panel --> Network and Internet --> Network and Sharing Center --> Change the adapter settings --> Properties, and then entered the appropriate information. 

Then I had my Workstation to the domain by going to Control Panel --> System and Security --> System --> System Properties --> Change computer name --> rename this PC, and then entered the appropriate information.
# SYS-255 Lab 02

## Commands Used 

* `whoami` A command to see who you are logged in as.
* `ping` A command used to say hey to other networks and machines.
* `nslookup` A command to query the DNS for a domain name and IP address. 
* `hostname` A command to see the name of a system.


***
# SYS-255 Lab 01


***
### Commands Used
1. 1
   * In PfSense, 1 allows you to reassign the network interfaces.
2. 2
   * In PfSense, 2 allows you to set the IP interfaces.
3. whoami
   * In Windows 10, this command displays who you are logged in as. 
4. hostname
   * In Windows 10, this command displays the name of the machine.
5. ping -n 1 champlain.edu
   * In Windows 10, this command will ping champlain.edu one time. 
6. ipconfig
   * In Windows 10, this command displays the networking information about the machine.

***
### Summary
First we went to vSphere and logged in, then we edited the settings of our firewall machine to add a LAN network adapter. Then I powered on the FW VM, and confirmed that vSphere and the VM have matching MAC addresses. Then I renamed the LAN and WAN, em1 and em0. Then we configured the IP interfaces. 

Now we switched to working on a Windows Workstation. I changed the network adapter, and then Hostname. Then I made a new administrator account. Then I configured the network settings in Windows. 

Back to the Firewall, I accessed it through Internet Explorer. Then I went back to the FW terminal and pinged champlainl.edu to confirm the internet connection. Then I enter a command into Powershell to figure out who I was logged in as, what my IP is, and what the hostname is.

No I had a phone appointment and they said I‚Äôll go in at 1:30 for my covid test and if it comes back negative (In 3-4 business days lol) they‚Äôll consider seeing me for the other thing
Oh that was the meeting?  I thought that was just an email after you scheduled an appointment or something
Tell me one covid symptom I‚Äôve had lol
They can‚Äôt do anything else
Oh they told me they‚Äôre going to test me for covid and that‚Äôs it
Let us know how your meeting with the health center goes?  (As long as you're comfortable with it of course)
I just spoke to him lol

Health center?
Or maybe I actually have had pneumonia for months like I thought
Okay I‚Äôm not going. I‚Äôm going to try to get a health center appointment later because clearly something is up. Def not covid but maybe a mental health thing

``` 
There's a lot of potential here for great work in the future, although it didn't really come together here. Essentially, you were all over the place, and couldn't seem to decide upon a central theme. As we discussed, in a paper this short you need to focus in very cleanly on a central theme with one specific lens and one specific section. By mentioning Freud and Lacan you put yourself in the position where you ended up roaming around. So, I think the talent is definitely here for great work, but work to come up with an effective theme and more assiduously pursue it.

<@!227204721809686528> what did you get on the paper? i got a 76

Bruh I just tanked the ARP reading quiz

do you put short story title in single quote or double quote the internet just says quotations
If it's science then not
If it's like a philosophical paper you can use "one" not I
using I means you put your own opinions into the piece and scudder wants it to be all facts
ive never had to do that why?
tf
Unless it‚Äôs literally a personal essay you should never ever do that
You should never use I in an academic essay
really?
Never
No
<@!408779745136738324> does scudder let you use `I`
Gay
I come

Yes
is this thier only song?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atbvLSP0JyA
Different story
Is dumb but a very important song to me
Crabwalk by party in the hills ü•¥
okay what song
No lmfao
i cant pick up tone well
for real?
That's the one
https://tenor.com/view/crab-safe-dance-gif-13211112
Grab rave
what song involves a crab
just kidding
girl in red?
Favorite song of mine actually inspired it heh
crab has got a funky vibe i dig it
what was the inspiration for this? just crab vibes or something deep
I'd appreciate it if you didn't treat me as though I don't know what I'm doing- he intentionally did the Disco ball with a smaller needle so it lightens significantly when it heals to give the effect that it's reflecting light vs the crab
Guys this is what I asked for and did a lot of research into this guy and had friends who'd gotten tattoos from him before? If you don't like it that's fine but this guy knows what he's doing and has been doing it for a long time
just the disco ball tho everything else looks good
the lines in it definately need to be darkened or this might fade pretty fast. i had a stick and poke that looked like that and it literally fell off
ummm\
oh honey
oh no
ITS A DISCO BALL AHAHA
üëÜ
im just a little worried about the pineapple but the crab is gorgeous
Can't get scammed if my sugar daddy gf pays for itüòåüôè
I like it
Bruh this is how I wanted it???

Seriously Sodexo won't fire you if you spit in someone's drink and they're a terrible company don't break a sweat for them

I'll take them out 371 is mine
we love to see it
I've told ping not to do this some many fucking times

But I don't know how to do that. I would suspect in the .config file for the terminal or there are some backend commands
Then don't use GNOME
but its ugly
It's home
That is the path
how do i change it from the icons to the actual file path

And damn a GNOME user
I don't actually know what you mean

<@416404018634686465> the PoE switch didn't work for the phone there is something I am missing that the connection need
But I don‚Äôt want to make her wait two more weeks
Honestly it‚Äôs probably just a sinus infection or allergies she needs meds for. It‚Äôs def not life threatening
ok keep us updated about the cat
We can plan at lunch. I just came back and she has cuts all over her face and like üëÄ
So if we get back in time and Paul‚Äôs around you can do resource without me

you guys are heathens and have apparently never had an actually good grilled cheese
why do you want bread with your cheese just eat the cheese alone
finally someone is speaking the truth
Yknow what I‚Äôm just gonna say it. GRILLED CHEESE IS GROSS
food waste bad, dumpster diving good
Rich man vibes
I‚Äôve been preparing for poverty all year
idk what my means even are anymore
We had some interesting characters who obviously lived well above their means
$3 to an old lady, rip to your resident, but also congrats to them for their income bracket
He‚Äôs definitely cursed. Did you warn them
My resident spent 15$ on that stupid thing
Called it. How much for?
<@!408779745136738324> we already sold that pig lmao
oh no
<@!298204230223659029> why
Sitting and annoyed because I wasn‚Äôt invited to the family reunion (not that I‚Äôd go and not that one should be happening during covid)
Not much why
Charlotte what‚Äôre you doing

Also is it teen pregnancy if the man is a teen but the woman isn‚Äôt
Heck yeah! Deliver those fruits
Guess who just became a local produce delivery man lol

‚ÄúMary-lind‚Äù -Paul, on Maryland <@!416404018634686465>
I went to Costco and was wearing a shirt with bugs on it and yellow jeans, and was mistaken for an employee by a very confused woman and I don‚Äôt know why
So akande either was fired or bullied out
Confirmed? No. But Don Laackman also didn‚Äôt ‚Äúleave suddenly of his own accord‚Äù
Have we confirmed that the pres was fired?
Can I still wear my heelys to Costco or are we past that we q society
because we have nothing better to do
why am I still awake?
how is anyone still awake
fuk
Hate crime time
Oh no i compromised myself
Filthy heterosexual? In this discord?
they‚Äôre asleep at the wheel here
I really do
You need your keeper to give you more enrichment
gotta smooth out the rough edges I‚Äôve been developing on my wasted gap year
I need to be moved to a new enclosure
I think if I went to a Vermont college id become more insufferable than I already am
sounds like things are going swimmingly
hell yeah
Dude our president, and director of reslife were both separately fired the last week of the semester things are NOT good
I can find commies everywhere, and if I can‚Äôt I make some, it all works out
you speak of it so highly
but you would find a few communists
you all say stuff like that
You‚Äôll want to die
Transfer to champ
man i ought to try to start making friends in my college
Joey is questionably straight tho
well what do ya know
There‚Äôs a few heterosexual here
you needed a hetero to bully
no it's because Charlotte asked to have comic relief
that‚Äôs just how cool I am B)
yes it's cahmplain students except for you
huh, I guess I never had much explained to me
I thought this was mostly Champlain students
Charlotte, Joey, Meave, Myself
only a few of us live in vermont
still sad none of you jokers came to the market, I have a deep need to see what everyone looks like
naw I could never do that stuff, most college students don‚Äôt have the gumption to chow on post secondhand goods
have fun
yes, but i will operate illegally
I gotta say, Champlain students throw out some pretty choice shit
they won't let any other food providers be on champlains campus
until I open my discount food stand
they have a campus monopoly
sodexo is so bad lmao
fuck sodexo
no I am just saying the covid hall because they wouldn't let me donate that stuff to the food drive and I am pissed
I don‚Äôt think eating pop chips is going to wipe me out
also maybe I‚Äôll get COVID but that was like earlier in the week and I feel fine
from dumpsters
it‚Äôs all sealed
from the donation bins or the dumpster because some of the stuff from the dumpster if from the covid hall
I‚Äôm ascending to my final form
I have been eating discarded snacks from Champlain dumpsters as well
I never worry about anything
it‚Äôs for my small business^tm don‚Äôt worry
I also raided the dumpsters as best I could
Okaaaay
Lol
just to annoy you
Bro wait who is still in burly area
stuff from donation bins
stuff from the bins in the dorm halls
why are you like this
Loot?üëÄüëÄ
Fuck wearing anything besides black and ski merch
Charlotte just dumped a bunch of loot at my house so she‚Äôs def around
I thought u both were in Lebanon what
oh did he go back to the flatlands?
I would hope he‚Äôd tell me if he was in town
surprisingly it wasn‚Äôt your boyfriend Charlotte, but he seems the type
one of them was wearing a YouTube merch t shirt which I thought was funny
cause I‚Äôm enough of a hick to check
two mass and one penn plate
I have no clue what age but they seemed able to buy booze
Thats weird they should all be home by now unless they‚Äôre seniors
they should be locked up for my safety
there was a horde of feral college students in the store earlier and one of them had a Champlain mask, explain yourselves

It's amazing comedy
goat comic
I love that far side so much

don't slander cal
N that was cal
you said you wanted to get dicked down by him
I hate grittt
You want to fuck Gritty
Charlotte just looked at me and told me to unload the gun instead of her wearing the bullet proof vest. she believes she can preform a vasectomy
Paul wants to fuck Linus tech tips
You lied to me then

also there‚Äôs a distinction between old stuff and stuff for old people
I don‚Äôt watch cspan, I‚Äôm saying that‚Äôs where you can really watch people die
CSPAN is from the 70s your point?
a website for 50 year olds
come on tell me this isn't good
https://trollalley.com/2021/04/20/dude-leaves-his-friend-during-a-car-jacking-gone-wrong/
my new thing is watching police impersonators get arrested
piss shit gore internet is a waste of bandwidth, I abandoned that shit a while ago
what about troll alley
liveleaks is boring
liveleaks and newsflare are great
your loss
CSPAN is fucking boring
watch the rulers of the world die in real time
watch CSPAN
I just like the idea of lining up 50yr olds and watching them die on live television
what, are you scared of a good orgy?
that doesn't sounds as fun
my plan is to dramatically increase all pesticide use and to ban organic crops so the sperm count will reach zero and humanity can have one big death orgy
what do you mean?
overdone bit
Finn it's not a joke if everyone smokes cigs and died at 50 the U.S would be a lot better
the liberal once again hides behind irony
idk I believe abortions up to 928 weeks are okay as well after 60 you should be killed
which is also wrong?
everyone involved in fighting that war should have been tried for crimes against peace and locked up forever
I do but we still do it to this day with protesters in the states
how do you not see this is demonic
unequivocally an act of great evil
they had speakers in the helis to play sounds of dead people and it was made to fuck with the vietnamese because of how spiritual they were
it was one of the worst atrocities of modern world history
also liking the vietnam war is scary
playing?
a subject that doesn‚Äôt particularly interest me
idk in the vietnam war I liked the phsylogical warfare of playing dead people from helicopters
Freud was right, it is all about penises
talking about guns is boring tho
it kills fascists
literally immaterial, it gets the job done
well a 7.62x39 round isn't as good as the 5.55x45
it‚Äôs the gun that beat America in vietnam lmao
what matters is that it‚Äôs cheap, modular and easy to clean
wow it's an iconic national flag and you don't know
I‚Äôm not a gun nut, I couldn‚Äôt tell you
Finn what round is chambered in an ak47
a gun so iconic it‚Äôs on national flags
only weapon that matters is the AK-47
the small nuke

The davy crockett rocket
M28 what
but do they have M-28s?
someone had to kill the nazis
The commies still have tanks
idk what to tell you
I just want my tank and M-28 or 29

a good philly is steak, gp, white onion, fungus and American cheese
according to the real cheesesteak makers
I seems like you don't
I‚Äôm a red but I still know how to make a cheesteak
you don't know how to act and you should like red you're a communist
they don‚Äôt know how to act
they know what they're doing
I also think using reds is wrong
Finn but it's a PHILLY cheesesteak it's named after them
it‚Äôs wrong
I literally don‚Äôt care if that‚Äôs how they do it in philly
sorry it's whiz not wiz
https://chuonthisfood.com/2012/07/09/ill-take-one-whiz-with/
absolutely wrong
anyone who has a cheesesteak with cheez wiz is a heathen
thats a cheesesteak
wiz whip?
one wiz whip please
why get a steak and cheese when you can instead get a philly wit da fungus
pasta with shrek jizz

literally the greatest vegetable
imagine being scared of onions
god damn mountain people don't know the difference smh
no a cheesesteak has veggies
I just supplements with pills
a steak and cheese is the same thing is a cheesesteak
I don't need fruits or veggies to survive
I ONLY WANT steak and cheese along with the bread NOTHING ELSE
He has only had one fruit
you still not able to eat your vegetables?
According to Paul
Which, folks, is distinctly different from a cheesesteak
only if I get a free steak and cheese
You offering ?
I know you get pegged but not another man
who said that
<@!278668843583537154> are you still straight

Marie Curie really doesn‚Äôt get the historical attention she deserves

(FYI wall of women is NOT the work of myself or the women‚Äôs and gender center)
But we‚Äôre dancing around the non-binary thing so hard that to the point where my boss doesn‚Äôt want to say women since it‚Äôs offensive
Or could be great
It‚Äôs highlighting women in history such as Marie curie and also female professors. I think it‚Äôs great
it‚Äôs very Mitt Romney
but that earlier tweet ‚Äúwe are gathering more information about the wall of women‚Äù is comedic in a way I can‚Äôt explain
not that there can‚Äôt be a good execution
also the phrase and concept of the wall of women is hilarious
there you go
The phrase I suggested was ‚Äúpeople who identify as or with women‚Äù
it is cool how hard colleges seem to fumble this shit, it can‚Äôt be that hard. Trans women are women, and are therefore included by the term ‚Äúwomen‚Äù and non-binary people are not, and are there for not included in the term
(Sarcasm)
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Non binary people are just women lite yknow
which would seem to invalidate nonbinary people as having a different expression
people keep lumping women and non-binary people together for women‚Äôs stuff
"We must get rid of the wgc it isn't inclusive enough"
yeah wtf
the one that pisses me off more is her insistence on 'women and trans women' writing thems eperately
email her anyway. she needs to hear it from more people
i think someone else already did
please email my boss to complain about these things they are problematic and she is ignorign

Howdy Folks!

I hope that you've been busy enjoying your summer, Resident Advisor (RA) Training isn't too far away and I am excited to meet you all soon. Here's a little about me...


I am Joshua McCormack, the new Area Coordinator (AC) for Central Area, my pronouns are He/Him/His

This is my first year at Champlain, and my first as a Professional in ResLife.

I have four years of experience in your shoes, two as a RA and two as a LRA.

I have a B.S. in Computer Science, and a M.B.A. in General Management, both from Plymouth State University.

I live in Valcour Hall, and looking to adopt a dog (open to both breed and name suggestions).

My favorite candy is Sour Patch Kids.

I'm a huge AtLA fan, can and will provide in-depth plot and character analysis upon request.

Also a big video game nerd, I both collect and repair retro consoles (Nintendo fanboy), and do PC gaming



Please Join our Staff Discord here¬†https://discord.gg/

and when you do, I'd love to get to know a little about y'all, could you please respond in the "introductions" chat on Discord with the following information:

Your name as you'd like it presented on your door tag

Your pronouns

What you're studying here at Champlain

How long you've been a RA

Your favorite candy

Favorite Color (and Second Favorite Color)

What do you geek out on? (Including but not limited to: hobbies, movies, tv, books, anime, topics, conspiracy theories etc.)


Thank you all, and I look forward to meeting you soon!

Coffee by itself (especially decaf) isn‚Äôt bad for you at all.

thats cool

i have never had the craving for coffee mostly bc i don't like it but all of the sudden i want coffee

one time I was talking to this libertarian who has the cousin of a girl I was involved with and he was like ‚Äúeveryone says libertarians just hate taxes but it‚Äôs so much more than that‚Äù and I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôve just heard everyone say you‚Äôre pedophiles‚Äù and my man had a 20 minute speech about it, I am not kidding
lol they are children and pedos at the same time
^
Democrat = liberal
Republican = liberal but angrier
Libertarian = liberal pedophile
they‚Äôre children
republicans = libertarian 
democrat = libertarian
hahahahaha
I met one who said he wasn‚Äôt allowed to have his own ideas that‚Äôs why he liked being libertarian
every libertarian I‚Äôve ever met either wanted to lower the age of consent or repeal the civil rights act
I had to fucking Google how to spell that English is a horrible language
No they want big tank that works and an m29 warhead

I mean if it were convenient I'd never say no
Do it it makes things ~spicy~
Oh no
I'm trying hard not to sleep with many people at champlain
lmao
that's not a dig at craiglist, I love it, it's just a very unstreamlined process for everything
Have you tried sleeping with enough people on campus that it becomes awkward
Fair enough
I don't think there's anything less streamlined than craigslist personals
And came about because crsigs list personals was discontinued
Its like Craigslist personals but more streamlined
What that
Anyone here ever tried doublelist with any decent results?

currently staring at the 0.6% scudder would need to give me in order for me to have a real A in the class
Even just about the post in general tbh
Especially if he didn't do any of it
I would be pissed

sonya no i was literally just in your office üò≠
like yes its a lot of work but if you do it outside the work it furthers the expectation that teachers should work outside school hours
idk if im old fashioned or new fashioned but why do these teachers complain about havign work work 80+ hour work weeks when they can literally just leave at the end of the day and shut their phone off for the weekend and on sick days but continue to overextend themsleves for nobodys benefit
At least I don't leave mine at work unlocked...
paul who hacks others computers always leaves his unlocked
man the insoles ad said people might be sore first few days of use but i was not prepared

oh i just opened the file on my laptop and now it works
They got reported for doing it last year but they're still a ra this year?
I havent been scripting this section, im going to work on it more later, but tonight ill mostly be studying for the test
Like they stole my banana republic pants one time and I searched for days until I saw they had them
my residents used to steal my stuff and i only found out about it during room checks
They give it back when we ask for it back but no apology or anything
Oh yeah they've admitted they have kleptomania but they're not doing anything about it,  unlocking our doors,  taking our stuff (mostly clothes) and we've even seen thin wearing our stuff
thats not funny but like WHAT
lmao
Housing just responded to me and my roommates after a month because our RA has been stealing our stuff and we are now threatening to go to the police

Why did this come up on my fyp what did I do to deserve chatulu smut
or just crush them and put them in a paper bag
Definitely this. Try to crush the cans so they can't be read, then try and put it in a bag with a bunch of other trash so it can't be easily seen. The best is if you have pringles cans, you can crush the cider cans, then put them in the pringles can to throw away
Bc it was a possible time sensitive issue but counseling center doesn't think its so time sensitive it needs to happen ASAP
why
?
Just have to consult almost every office in skiff about res
hypothetically in minecraft
i have nothing to be careful about : )
not that i need to be careful
ras arent supposed to go through the trash anyway
thats true but im a careful person
imo
i used to put empty vodka bottles in juniper several times a week. theres no cameras so nobody really cared
Next time

dont recycle cider cans in ur hall take them directly out to the recycling bin -someone who has never once drank in a residence hall before
yeah probably cleaning crew
Enter cans were taken out too
Def not ra
probably the latter
one of two things: another ra, or one of the cleaning crew that collect bottles
Bruh i recycled c9dar can and someone took it out
im assuming minor car accident or somethhing?
one of my students i guess got hurt but i havent been told any details
no
has anyone heard any news this morning about an incident downtown?
Men :/
like obviously I'm going to tell the truth when it comes back around to me its so dumb to lie
True. And why lie about shit like that
everyone knows i've been known to make out with them here and there and I don't care if a rumor is true but this one is just straight up false and annoying
yep
Isn‚Äôt like Maeve point 2 that you don‚Äôt like men?
not suprised
well be warned that he's apparently a douchebag
he just got onboarded onto my capstone team
oh no
what a mess
also other nasty shit happened to me at that party so
which is fucking hilarious because i explicitly do not like him at all I think he's fucking nasty
Loki
who?
no no the kid on the rugby team
scudder or jimmy?
I just found out that someone on the rugby team is spreading rumors that I made out with him at a party when i did no such thing : )
And backne.  That shit sucks.  Especially when you get a big pimple on your shoulder and it rubs against you shirt/jacket all day or if you wear a bag
Prepare to have itches on your back that you can't reach lol
the acne has started
back hair is coming
mmm
don't scart me but i genuinely think i cannot cry nor would i ever do so in front of gary scudder
It works
I‚Äôve done this
just go into his office and just start crying
Scudder: emails everyone saying the trip cost has gone up by like 400 bucks
Also Scudder, who doesn't even know how stressed I am about the cost yet:

But my grade got bumped today is what I am saying
thats where ur extra is coming from
yeah
Yeah I already had that
:p
see

Yeah just interesting because I was around a 96 yesterday but he had already put in the extra credit
yes'
bc it means possible score ie 110/100
soo extra credit means you can get over a 100
yeah
Yee extra credit was the best way to go
in the little poll he did
instead of drop
And I didn't know if that was from grade drop or misinput
did you choose extra credit?
he dropped my lab 2-1
Okay because I am somehow over 100
yes he did
i have a 99.78
yes i  guess
Did your grade go up?

i just said i am 20 on a form am i actually stupid
I almost got hit by a guy who then ashed his blunt out the window
Some of these people need to be reminded that they aren't untouchable
Last year some idiots in a car were yelling at me and one of my residents crossing the street, and I had an ice cream cone in my hand, so I just chucked it at their car
Once by this f****** 95-year-old ancient old lady who look like she was still blonde in a coffin and then both other times by out of state plates
Yeah I've almost been hit like three times this semester on the crosswalk by Rowell
There have been way too many close calls at that crosswalk and it's ridiculous. People who drive in Burlington don't give two shits if they hit someone
Wth that's scary af
So get this, I'm walking back from eats with Autumn, and we each have a soda in our hands as were walking back, and we're crossing the street while this moron with Mass plates almost hits Autumn and starts yelling at us from inside his car despite the fact that we were already halfway past the crosswalk and he didn't hit the fucking breaks until the last second, so I fucking took the lid off of my drink and threw it on his car, and as we're walking away, he yells "hey get back here", so I turn around and fucking yell back saying "WE HAD RIGHT OF WAY DIPSHIT" and this dumbass says "no you don't". I fucking shouted at the top of my lungs at him saying "IT'S A CROSSWALK IN A SCHOOL ZONE YOU MASSACHUSETTS FUCK HEAD" and he keeps talking shit as he drives away, so I looked at him as he was going up the street and I yelled "SHUT THE FUCK UP" so loud that I hurt my throat. I'm so fucking fed up with these stupid fucks who drive around here
found it thanks <@303228816631791627>
I don't have your number plus its prob on silence
I would offer to call it for you but like
Oh shit
also i think its on silence

I certainly won't say I'm a professional, but I do study psychology more than most, and the statistics here seem skewed
Yeah I don‚Äôt know the whole thing but like üßê
I'm not saying they don't have DID,  I don't know their medical history, but it is just very unlikely
I thought I had did when I was 15 but it turns out having different emotions doesn‚Äôt make you different people lol.
Exactly
Like mania etc
Not to mention that a lot of psychologists think it‚Äôs usually misdiagnosed
oh i just didnt understand what you were saying before
It's just the diagnosis rate of DID is low, so much that it's considered rare, but for there to be four systems in a group of 40-50 people is hard to believe
?
not that they havent always but why are people taking them seriously ig
i dont understand why people are faking this now
what are the chances that we now have a fourth system in the rainbow room group chat just three months after the first system came out as plural? astronomically low
Where the way the end lines are interpreted are different

anxiety attacks are the more random nausea, heart rate, etc
panic attacks for me are triggered by loud noises. I hyperventilate, shake uncontrollably, cannot control crying, and I have trouble moving

panic attack usually for me has nothing to do with anxiety hence the attack part
just random heart rate, dizzy, nausea, etc
panic attacks and anxiety attacks are quite different
like has nothing to do with panic
thats a panic attack

Just because I have rachet straps in the back of my car, a bat, knifes, and get iced coffee when it's below zero out dosent make me a phyco
Hey hey
or iced coffee if youre a psychopath
pisses me off tbh theyre gearing it more towards food now
idk im not going to pressure you into liking coffee but i didnt really until i tried mocha and maple lattes. its just so yummy and is a different kind of warm thing
That's like hardly a rewards program
I'll have to keep that in mind
I used to not and now it‚Äôs my favorite thing in the world
I‚Äôm a coffee person
I dont really drink coffee
Oh I have never tried it
I like their lemonades and matcha green teas
Starbucks is more per beverage so there‚Äôs probably more free ones but I really can‚Äôt rationalize spending 6$ on a coffee that‚Äôs 3 at dunks
Ah. As bad of a token economy as Starbucks has
Dunkin changed their program so now you have to spend 90$ to get a 3$ free coffee
i just hate medical
if i had to guess probably from my sinus infection in august
ah
i just have lung damage and get it frequently
pneumonia doesnt work that way it isnt contagious

that yaml file or the csv file?
thats how
with open(filename, encoding='utf-8') as file:
you have to specify the unicode
encode with utf-8


there has to be a typo in your yaml

thats an interesting error
hmmm
yes
at this point im trying to get into the yaml file
the way paul has it settup is very nice
use dictReader
<@416404018634686465> I found a better way to grab the contents in the csv file

It's an issue with regex in the yaml

Yes
Nope

You can pick up food as a reward for not canceling therapy

Okay I deleted the original message because I second guessed myself, but no.  I am right.  The bug in my code that I've been trying to track down is a bug in my professor's code.  We're designing algorithms for a "cat" and a catcher.  The cat tries to reach the edge of the grid and the catcher tries to block their escape.  They take turns moving one space and blocking a space.  My professor's code makes it so that the catcher can't block any spaces on the same x line or y line since he checks if the catcher is trying to block a space whose x is not the cat's x AND is not the cat's y when it should be OR.   Right now, if the cat is on (3,2) and the catcher wants to block the postion (3,5), it checks (3 != 3) && (2 != 5) which returns false because 3 == 3.  Fuck me I didn't think to check his code for bugs.

these are the best pair of jeans i ever owned

yeah
They are. You're kinda tall right?
i almost exclusively wore american eagle but levis are so nice
Ah
because otherwise they are baggy on the legs
thats WHY i need skinny
I like American eagle because they're some of the only jeans that fit me well. I'm short, so I have trouble finding jeans that aren't too long, but they also need to not be skinny because I have thick thighs and ass.
yuh
<@416998580071563264> you down to finish the SYS-320 in a little I almost got it done

I used to
‚Ä¶ you can
Yeah, they should elt you bc like most laundry matt's let you use a debit card
I just wish I could use my debit card when doing it
Well yeah but I would've thought it would've been part of housing that you would get to do free laundry while living there. It is an expensive school
every apartment
laundromats, etc
i mean you will pay for laundry in life that is just life
they do but you can buy the key for the machine online
Big sadness
It's wild that they make you pay to do laundry
When the vending machine won't take your dollars so now you have a pile of wet clothes
Like body horror not horror in general
Idk it makes me think sbt something else

All due respect to horror fans but how can people enjoy that shit
Which was probably loosely based on the 2 second clip of Nope I watched before bed ü§¢
Yeah I just had a dream that Paul was trying to kill me then I had a dream that this Airbnb host/scientists decided to stop the end of the world using human sacrifice
Did you take your dose of noghtquil
I did not sleep
that really sucks.
it wasn't that they had to see a social worker that made them feel like shit. it was the going behind their back and reporting them after eavesdropping on a private, sensitive conversation then lying about it
then i went to a therapit whose goal was un transing
acutally i did happen to me come to think of it
yeah i would feel like shit if that happened to me
like as part of my therapy training I will be a mandated reporter and I know the protocols and everything
like yeah that is something youre required to report. but it wasn't the RA who eavesdropped and they didn't disclose the info with her. it was a private convo
I guess our perspective is skewed as ras but that‚Äôs something I‚Äôd have to report
Oh that‚Äôs tough
they were discussing how they were upset with their parents and depression was hitting hard because of it but they were getting support
whatd they say
no
i mean were they saying they gonna kill them self
oh and she deliberately eavesdropped on a conversation and reported confidential stuff to the RA and now one of my roommates is required to attend therapy and see a social worker
i keep accidently leaving my loofa in the showers lol
yeah i get washing them in the sink but she just left them there for a long time
I‚Äôve left‚Ä¶ er‚Ä¶ worse things in the shared bathroom
I mean gross but like this has definitely happened to me
eek
And the one time she forgot to put her clothes out she tries to use the washer and breaks it
oh wow
There was this super super rich girl my first year and she paid for a laundry service üò¨
and has left bloody undies in the bathroom sink
Honestly that happened every time even if it was only one
That and then kids put them in the tray and ruin the washer
but then obv there was tidepod casing left of the clothes so she hand washed them in the kitchen sink
im sorry about your clothes from hill
i use them and they work fine
I think tide pods should be banned on college campuses tbh
Wtf
bruh wtf
like she used 36 tidepods to do one load of laundry because she doesn't know how to do laundry
no respect for boundaries and i think they literally dont know how to do basic things
why
thanks. mostly just everyone (except me) is pissed at one person
im sorry, hopefully there will be less problems in the future

bruh join the call peeps
Yeah they just keep adding stuff
and eTErNiTy
It also seems like they make things up to propel thor's story.  They never incorporate it from the start.  Like how the dark elves just show up out of nowhere in the second movie.  Hela in the third, and now the necro-sword in this one
Yeah agreed
‚ÄúBring your daughter back to watch her dad die‚Äù yeah great wish
I agree on the viking magic not healing cancer is bullshit though
Like first one to solve the puzzle gets one wish
Because only the first person there could make the wish
Then the guy died? Why couldn‚Äôt Thor make a wish
To be fair he only got one wish
I thought you could only make one wish so he brought his daughter back
Why the fuck would someone || die of cancer || in a marvel movie and why || didn‚Äôt the guy wish her to not have cancer so she could raise his kid with Thor. Like there was a magic wishing machine and Viking magic but CANCER outsmarts it?! Like the other characters have been nearly killed and healed with magic but human illness is the line? || I just don‚Äôt get the logic
I thought it was cute
Yeah it was awful
You think?
I finished watching the Thor movie and it ended exactly the wrong way
Damn its pretty cold today but I hate pants
Oh wait you mean like actual shoes.  He made me barefoot sandals
Make some.  Dillon made me some
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02Ahz-Bc5Us&t=169s
id like to give the 2nd one a full try
based on like all the ankle research ive done, there are 2 camps both with equally expensive shoes. 1 who chose to get all the support possible and 2 the ones who tend towards a minimalist style show like this. Wearing supportive shoes when you don't really need to makes your ankle weaker, while strengthen them and then removing support allows them to support themselves
Are they reviewed well? That seems like a marketing thing
https://www.vivobarefoot.com/us/magna-forest-esc-mens
guys fr tho i really want barefoot shoes but they v expensive
whoa those dogs are barking homie

are you susing the rope or the glock

suuuusssssssss
ummmmmmmm
what

That‚Äôs how these things start
i bought some rope for camping and it is nice to squeeze
But you need a permit to even conceal carry in mass
Vermont has the most max gun laws in the country
lol yeah bc those are open carry states
Carry but it gets complicated outside NH And VT
you gonna carry or keep at home?
Maybe a Glock or a different handgun brand
which one?
thats just me and my own philosophy
https://tenor.com/view/what-sponge-bob-shocked-confused-what-the-gif-12645964

There will probably be a day in your life where you can't even remember his name, the farther away you get from what happened, the less it's like it even happened

Unless you have pots

Because you exercise lol

Also high humidity is normal in this area but God damn it hitting different this week. Like the humidity was over 80% this morning woth high temps and has now, forunately, has broken because it's raining
she knows
For reference people can see when you screenshot their story on Instagram so be careful
update

toasty tho in NC
Like this is standard in Vermont
is that a lot
FUCK this
i hope it goes well for both of them,
Yeah that just seems like an attempt to shut down any criticism people would have of Nick
the one thing that i disagree with their partner about is the two of them thinking this is a hate crime
which is hilarious considering that hardly anyone at the college is completely neurotypical
and when questioned it was always 'well im adhd so'
thats why i had to stop hanging out with him because it was always 'we have to do what nick wants'
i hope so too
It's nice that they have a healthy relationship, and I hope that this doesn't ruin it if they both seem happy, but I hope it gets Nick to think more about how they speak to/treat people
and i went to hs with their current partner and she is so sweet and not naive at all when it comes to this stuff
i think the reality is not even nick knows the full story
yeah i can see that being a red flag
Yeah, the only thing that is really publicly known is that they've been in and out of relationships very quickly, which doesn't make someone immediately guilty, but it could be a sign
I guess my point is that I don't think all the rumors are true, I know some are, but the people trying to 'cancel' him don't have the same story. like everyone is saying something different, and for a case to be presented against nick they need at least some consistency
im assuming that this would also apply in his relationships
like you don't want a kazoo? you don't want to play chess? too bad
Yeah this convo is staying in here
in any context
obviously keep this in the discord but i dont think nick understands what consent is
I spoke to one of their exes who had a lot to say about them being way too forward with their relationship. Apparently they had spoken to an AC at the very end of a semester and that was the only reason a title IX wasn't filed. Obviously we will never know for sure, but that's what I had been told by someone very involved in all of this
did nick do something weird and problematic? yes. did he rape anybody? no
i think people are taking one thing and turning it into another. and also getting him mixed up with matthew's story
I've heard some conflicting information, but I'm taking everything I hear from either party with a massive grain of salt
Ive started grinding my teeth again : (
People really do suck.  It wouldn't have surprised me if someone crazy filed a title ix against Nick like with the Alessia debacle and then it went through the grapevine that he had a title ix, but the fact that people have been falsely spreading that he has those reports against him when he simply doesn't is actually a huge problem
wow
Yeah thats horrible
I‚Äôm horrified that it had to come to this
Interesting
When I was a kid, I genuinely believed that a bread bowl was a "red bowl" and I got soup in a bread bowl one time and was so upset it didn't come in a red bowl. Child me was weird.

Which was terrifying in the moment don‚Äôt get me wrong but it‚Äôs funny to think about now.
I used to get cat called but only when I wore thigh highs üòÇ
Honestly (and this is a hot take) I‚Äôve never felt unsafe in Burlington and I used to dress like an absolute whore and walk around at night. Like as long as you‚Äôre keeping an eye on things and being smart, I wouldn‚Äôt stress about running. Would I suggest running on like pine street or by city hall? Maybe not. But besides that I think things are fairly safe
and that's because you keep buzzing it randomly to scare the shit out of me or pointing it at me and saying bzzz
Silence communist
but instead i will watch running tips
running do be given that certain brand of endorfins tho üëÄ
oh yeah i am 100% not supposed to have it
I think Bruce banned those at champ
dillon hates it
i have a taser i keep in my backpack water bottle holder
Just carry a gun
yeah I don't recommend running at night, especially alone. can you do a home workout instead, like russian twists or weights or something?
i want to run more but its dangerous at night now and gym closes in 30 mintues
ooh fun
mine is about replublicans and gas prices and the supply chain
its about üåà basic issues in counseling and professionalismüåà
SAME
im also delirious and trying to finish a paper and hating every second of it lol
anyway. I am glad that I was able to discuss that a little because i don't have a place here to really discuss it without seeming like an asshole when really im a) curious and b) confused
One of them applied to work with me but one of their alters apparently has no recollection of that or me which is interesting
but like theyre still engaged as far as I can tell? theyre both/all poly though so they have multiple partners but are engaged to each other so its super complicated
its like candy to dive into evaluating from a psychological perspective but there are so many things that are off about the whole situation
excuse to break up?
btw they are engaged. and now the one who proposed said that one of the alters proposed to the other before the other split and one of the alters is only interested in one of the pthers alters and its really complicated
or at least recognize that even if they really do have DID, which i'm not saying they don't have because im not them and i am not their psychiatrist, that they learn how to manage it and recognize reality vs. perception
I know it‚Äôs different with Every body but you don‚Äôt fully mature until 25 so hopefully they grow out of it
I think that they're both/all seniors though
I totally get it i just hope that they don't do anything that they will regret later
ah yeah that is super common
Most people go through a harsh puberty in college so I get it.
I used to think I had multiple personality disorder but it was just because I was going through puberty and didn‚Äôt understand fluctuating emotions + disassociation
and theyve set up bots on the discord server and they all have their own pfp that, and I quote, "are how we look in our headspace) which are anything from anime cat kids to instagram models
and im like hon.. not to be invalidating or anything, but even though your reality may seem real to you it isn't actually real
Like ‚Äúwhen I‚Äôm mad I‚Äôm Thomas‚Äù ya kno
I think they think it‚Äôs like ‚Äúi have different personalities/emotions so that must be did‚Äù
or one of them says theyre 200+ years old, and another one of their alters is 12
omg thats literally my friends. like...i dont wanna invalidate what you're going through, but it is unfortunately not possible to actually alter into an elf or fae
I genuinely don‚Äôt think they realize it‚Äôs not real though
Like that wonderland system person who said they had alters that were babies and elves and stuff
Like how during the summer everyone on tiktok had DID and so many alters. Obviously you know psych stuff and know that you can‚Äôt have non human alters and you won‚Äôt instantly be able to count and isolate named alters
Idk the way social media popularized DID over the summer proved to me that most people don‚Äôt truly have it
the likelihood of such an event (two people, a couple) developing (or at least breaking into the alters) the same very rare disorder within days of each other is astronomically low though, which is why it's so interesting to me.
that would be like hallucinations or schizo or something like that. but it's not
oh no I believe them, I just don't know what else to classify the phenomena as. It is most similar to a Folie a deux, but I dont think they have a delusion
`delusional diagnosis` as in you don't think they actually have the condition?
like, I see these people almost every day. they never showed any sign of alters until the one split. It's wild
so something interesting has happened in my school's lgbtqia+ office. One person's host has shattered into an entire systen of ~10 known alters. That in itself is interesting, but then what's even more interesting is that their significant other ALSO broke into a system almost immediately after. Folie a deux  (where the same  delusional diagnosis is shared by 2+ people of close relation) is pretty uncommon, to the point that the DSM5 doesn't even have it listed. but this isn't a delusion as far as I can tell. DID is  really, really rare (~1.5% of global pop) and for them both to develop it at the same time is such a phenomenon
mood
Hence why the brain invented üåàdissociationüåà
Me neither
||i do not like feelings sometimes man||
Now that you've resurfaced those memories of him then it may do you some good to get closure. No pressure either way, I just hate that you have to go through it.
still have a physical reaction to mentions/pictures/anything of him
i guess i should meet up with him, the hate i have for him used to require so much energy
ties were cut semi still are
Maybe try meeting them once for closure and see how it goes, then you can cut ties if you need to?
I‚Äôd do it if I were you but it‚Äôs not going to be easy
I think personally I‚Äôve gotten a lot of closure from talking to people who wronged me at one point or another, but it could create different problems
mmmmmmm
||I found an old instagram that I and someone who wronged made together. I reached out to them to ask them if they would like to keep it bc we used it to share our art and they said they are proud of me for transitioning. and want to know if we would like to ever meet up with to talk. i feel personally feel that it would be really good for me to do so bc at one time they were the only person keeping me alive, but that hurt me so much in the end ||
Well yeah sure of course
Don‚Äôt get me wrong if they approach and say ‚Äúdue to x thing I‚Äôm having a hard time with this‚Äù I‚Äôd help them make a plan but like dude
What the fuck??
In my African American lit class my students told me it‚Äôs racist to assign homework during black history month as well üòÇ
That and the new trend of saying like ‚Äúactually I‚Äôm bipolar I can‚Äôt do homework‚Äù
Me neither tbh they really be doing some dumb shit
Idk why college students think that‚Äôs funny anymore
Bruh this account is too much (tw: depression)

i need the north house lore
That's what I said lol
Just make some triples like uvm does
The only dropouts have all been women though so they can't stick guys in those rooms
So far yes
Oh like are they still planning to move students out of there
What are you asking specifically?
What‚Äôs the north house deal currently?
I want pictures of people throwing whipped creme at you
Yesterday during our 2:1, Juliana said "Yeah we kind of shot ourselves in the foot with North House." And I had to keep from saying "Yeah and your boot is on my neck." Because Juliana doesn't deserve that.
Idk I take every opportunity to not pay my taxes but if it‚Äôs a major issue for whatever reason I say don‚Äôt stress about it
God forbid the college earning tens of thousands from each of its students has to pay $2 in tax on average for each ra purchase
Juliana is okay with tax if they give you a hard time
i say give it until 10:10 and if juliana doesnt message you back then just buy as is
true
No luck on crust.  They have pie but that would be too expensive for the budget I requested and they're throwing whipped cream pies at our faces.  An actual pie would hurt
i dont know how many pie crusts you are getting though, i am assuming
i get that but in this case it would be less than a dollar. if they pitch a fit about it toss them some quarters ya know. its not your fault that they are unable to get back to you
They were very explicit about using tax exempt and the consequences of not using it so I want o be careful.  I can check on the pie crusts
(alternately- do they sell pre made pie crusts? those come with pie tins and would be tax exempt)
honestly in this case i would say it is better to ask for forgiveness than permission since they set you up for failure
All food except for pie tins and I want to get permission to just get them with tax to make sure so I dont have to come back to this personal hell to get it tax exempt later
(this is why we had a walmart specific card the whole time i was an ra)
what are you buying
if you get them the form they are unable to print?
wtf
I'm starting to hate my job.  Walmart changed their tax exempt process so now you need an extra form with your name and the company id on it and they don't have any of those forms here, they have to be printed by the college.  The only manager they have that can override that isn't here today.  I've been here for an hour and Juliana *won't message me back*
Awww

Aww poor baby
Me too buddy it‚Äôs okay
This one got rejected by its mom

there's a recent pic in <#775064619177607199>

Rude

```Mom,

I have to tell you something that you are not going to like. I have shedualed a consultation with my orignal pick for a top surgeon, Dr. Kathy Rumer on 1/31. I understand that you do not think she is a good choice on the count that she is a DO and not an MD. I reconize that historically they had very different practices, but from what I have read DO, like MDs, require a high GPA and a pasings MCAT score inorder to attend a their respective programs after obtaining a their pre-med BS. Both also have residencies. Dr. Rumer a lot or experience preforming Top Surgeries and preforms at least 150 per year according to her website. Dr. Rumer earned her medical degree from Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine, where she also completed a fellowship in plastic and reconstructive surgery and a residency in general surgery. She opened her own practice in 2007 and has made a big name for herself as an East Cost surgeon. ```
i have to write letters defending this woman from my mother lol
i told me mother i was going to go with dr rumer for a consalt and she said that she wasn't a real dr

<@!301516213773795328> tell Kay that with Julianas permission she can be covered by someone not in your pairing
Nah I think it‚Äôs fair haha
I think that could probably get you in trouble with your AC unless you check with them first.
If Kay really wants that tell her she has to pay you
They're like "I swapped with two people this month" like okay?? You still worked the same amount?
BRUH KAY IS CONTINUING TO PUSH IT
Like ur friends are watching a movie? Okay maybe?? Reschedule if it's that important- that weekend my best friend literally rearranged their birthday party plans (so that it's no longer on their bday) to accommodate my duty schedule- we all makin sacrifices
^^^
I mean if they agreed to it, that's their problem.
Do I feel bad they're on duty all weekend? Yes but yknow still
Anyways yes that's my beef for the day
Yeah.  I think that it's unfair for them to complain about it since it's their fault they didn't check the schedule and since they already agreed to it a while ago.
It's totally on them for not looking at their personal schedule before idk I'm just like Kay rlly kinda tried manipulating me into taking their shift and I am not feeling it
We got you back maeve üòé üê∏
Like bruh ur really gonna whine about being on duty all holiday weekend now? We scheduled duty nights WEEKS ago and I have important shit to do
I think you did the right thing at the end

Yes

In Southern Vermont at okemo I would say there was more Connecticut people because it's close to New York and cheaper living so a lot of people from Wall Street lived in Connecticut and went to southern Vermont because it was a horrible car ride
people from LA who do not understand that they stick out like a sore thumb
I have met some really funny cali people tho
I mean yeah we get those people, but a lot of mass and ny
Connecticut isn't real it's like Delaware
I would argue you're forgetting new jersey and Connecticut
it's a tourist economy man, people have terms to in and out groups
but the flatlanders we get are mostly from mass and new york
more or less
So flatlander isn't just mass and new York? Its any state is that what I am hearing
i miss 2019
in 2019 i went to country where i was legal to drink
this article says people would call someone from colorado a flatlander, which I agree with
charlotte is wrong
https://www.vpr.org/post/where-do-terms-woodchuck-and-flatlander-come#stream/0
She says it's only New York
Charlotte says you're wrong
talk to an old guy
ask anyone from here
Yes I like that better
Find me that definition
if youd prefer masshole that's an option too
in vermont, flatlander is someone from out of state, specifically new york and mass
also again, I tell you
yes
Mount Mansfield?
I went to Mountain High School
brother I live like 10 miles from the tallest mountain in the state
I grew up around more mountains than you
Well you should read first

a guy from mass who comes to vt is a flatlander, I didn't invent the term
No it isn't
yes it is
Flat lander isn't defined by any state or states
Jericho is flatter than the town I grew up in
I will not allow a guy from mass use that word
you‚Äôre the flat lander
projection
Finn you're a flat lander

Am I supposed to stick my dick in this?
Yeah I just removed it for now and we can install it later
And then have the system reboot
Can you push it to the end of the sequence
I would restart after it?
That is very odd
Huh
The problem is the TS fails like you can get it back normally but it won't allow you to install anything after it
I've never run into that happening except for resource issues, but these systems are beefy
Can you push a restart? If not make a quick cmd script to reopen explorer and stick it in after
Never heard of it before
Huh
TortoiseHG is the reason the Games TS is failing because it just shuts off half of windows

Right
Not here lol
dox yourself

Yayyy
It‚Äôs by Dillon

You want to pick me up by my house üëâüëà
both lanes or just the right lane?
Idk it‚Äôs your call but you‚Äôre leaving at rush hour
Yeah but it was backed up basically to Williston
Don‚Äôt forget to feed the kids
is it just the construction after exit 14?
bad?
Don't take interstate, construction
ur moms house
<@425781751516889118> <@303228816631791627> Where should I meet yall? at 5:30ish
Please get stove from 188
cant get any info about check in so hopefully its easy
i would suggest the blue route (rte 15) because otherwise it is 2.5 hours of interstate
Yes
Maybe 6
Miles teddy and I will probably be there 5:30 ish
thats smart
Okay. So you guys probably won‚Äôt be at the camp until 7 or 8 pm so I‚Äôd eat something small before so you‚Äôre not starving
yup!
Correct?
Okay so new deal is 
3:30 me and miles
5:00 max Brandon  with abijah 
5:15-5:30 Dillon and Isabella with Paul
i still got homework i wanna do before i hit the road so ima stick to 5 lmao
Lol
Lok
we could take max if he wanted (not to throw another wrench in it)
Cool lol. I mean we have space ig
Ig
yeah whatever you wanna do. so just me and miles in my car at 3:30 then?
I followed the conversation and I thought the plan was that I would be going with Paul and Isabella.  I would rather go with them I think for the space
If you‚Äôd rather go with Paul there‚Äôs space
We talked about swapping you with Isabella so you don‚Äôt have to wait as long
Wait what?  Am I leaving with you guys now?  I thought I was going with Paul
<@246405757908549633> so see you at 3:30 at skiff with <@416404018634686465>
Just to jump in on this maybe be there closer to 5:15 so you can leave at 5:30
See you at 5:30 then. As well do you want me to pick you up at your place or you come to the apartment.
More time to prep
5:30 is pog
https://tenor.com/view/sheesh-sheeesh-sheeeesh-bro-bruh-gif-22818626
worth it tho
My back is gonna hurt so bad after this weekend
https://tenor.com/view/cursed-emoji-fist-emoji-crying-emoji-emoji-fist-gif-20999569
Do you want to do 3:30 or 5:30
Enjoy your ~last~ cozy night in bed
No rush I‚Äôm just being mean

Mostly for Paul

It‚Äôs your call. You can come with me at 3:30 or Paul st 5:30
So you don't want to ride with Dillon and me
Nah I‚Äôm good nvm I would have taken the extra time to nap lol
Okay I‚Äôll pack potatoes lol
Yes
YES
Do we like home fries
you wont be the only one XD
come on dillion it will only be 2 hours of music that isn't in english
XD
enought to make a grown man cry
XD
yeah D:
Isabella don't leave me alone with paul for a 2 hour drive
I think probably not
Or we can jam 5 people in my car and take Isabella
<@425781751516889118> ?
Want to swap with Dillon
Not ideally, how much later?
this is a little rude ngl
@everyone
do we wanna try to do a group call to clarify things?
that works lmao
Either max or Brandon go with abijah everyone else go with Paul
2007 Saab 9-8x
God I don‚Äôt know anymore
Kgp 924
the pin says abijah gets me tho?
I got my car info
Also
It‚Äôs the only pin ü•≤
I don't actively check pins tbh lol
Guys it‚Äôs literally pinned
With the seats down
That makes sense tho Soo I have to whole back
Lmao
Well max messaged me XD
Ok
You‚Äôre getting Brandon and Paul is getting max and Dillon
Just tell me who I'm grabbing and where I guess?
But idk lol
I thought I was getting the late people
Oh
Lol
No
Yeah that's what I assumed
abijah has got me and brandon
Ok. Is it possible to do it a little later?
we figured it out
i can try and figure it out with him
Oh my god I love you guys but the reading comprehension is lacking
wait i gotta bring my stuff up?
<@425781751516889118> would it be possible to pick you up at skiff at 3:30
I'm still getting stuff together
Okay thank god
Max and Dillon are the only ones who need to figure out how to get abijah stuff
Yes
So that means I can just pack my stuff in his car when I meet him right?
Paul‚Äôs and mine? Like none that‚Äôs why only you and abijah are riding in his suv so we can load it
Wait how much space is in his car?
I guess it‚Äôs fine. Paul has final say but

A backpack.  Not packed yet but im not planning on bringing anything I cant fit in it
How big a bag? Like can you send a pic? There‚Äôs very limited space in Paul‚Äôs car
I'm bringing a pile of blankets because my sleeping bag and stuff disappeared into the shadow realm in NC, but yes
he packs like a maniac
One bag including sleeping and pad and everything?
If I only have one bag, should I still drop it off there?
2
So that abijah can bring it
Also how long of a drive is the campsite for planning purposes
Why do we have to drop our stuff off?

<@303228816631791627> pin pls
He‚Äôs going with abijah
<@293489371309670410>
I feel like I‚Äôm missing someone
Additionally if you are in Paul‚Äôs car ( <@246405757908549633> <@618173952904134676> ) you need to drop stuff off at my apartment tonight pls
I need to find my Tuque
Maybe even gloves
@everyone hats, sweatshirts, blankets, etc are a must.
That's frosteeeee
Shhhit
New low of 35 for Saturday
you can have the other one then
I think I forgot my mat
yes no problem
Can I snag one? I only have a bag
i have 2 extra sleeping mats btw if yall need them (yes they are essential so you dont rip the tent lol)
everyone else should drop everything they dont need in the car, though. so like, backpacks, sleeping bags, sleeping mats
just bring what you need when you leave with him
you are all good since you are going with abijah
what should we drop off at your place tomorrow?
Gn
If there is 1
I would benefit from that
Ye
Do we have a list of things we need specifically?
https://tenor.com/view/smoking-grandpa-gif-25041234
üò≠

lol XD
Must be the wrong Saab
idk why two
example

same spot on my old commute
almost lost a few to moose
XD
bruh
Not the special Saabs tho
with a bash bar
but a moose will total a full size pickup
white tailed deer are everywhere
thats what we have to worry about with deer here
they are mofo
yeah
If we see a moose it will be on the highway and we will be avoiding hitting it
i fucking LOVE bears
oh and if you see a BEAR
if you see a moose tho i want hella pictures
ye
Higher if you‚Äôre wet
Too warm to freeze
54 is when you can get hypothermia, but we wont let people freeze XD
and be careful. dont get eaten by a moose
but like dont freeze plz
Same
i would die
its been consistently at lease 80 here
yeah
because thats like cold
That‚Äôs warm for this time of year
Why?
please be careful
ye
The point is bring a sweatshirt or two and maybe a blanket
üòÑ
it was 52 in my room this am
thats me
And he was HOT last night
Paul keeps ours below 60

@here ?
Does anyone want to go to the store while I have minimal motivation? Otherwise waiting until Thursday
tru
We should get ramen in case we get hungry

<@502272136585412619>
rude
whos teddy?
teddy is getting burgers, rolls, and breakfast
some of them, some i have to buy
Are those all things that we have already?
looks good for me
<@293489371309670410>
where can we see the list
or additional things we need
@everyone reply now if there is anything missing from the grocery list
I can drive through campus and pick stuff up so y‚Äôall don‚Äôt have to haul it if you let me know when and where
XD
Smh
mine will be in the back of my car üòõ
sounds good. so max and abijah load up shit in van and leave around 5. this means EVERYONE else needs to have their camping gear at my apartment thursday night
I can wait
and max could go with paul (if this makes more sense to abijah)
people could drop their bags off the night before
well if its easier would you like to take dillon and leave at 1 ish?
im off at 12 XD
i can be earlier if people wanna hang
sick
yeah ill be there at 5
so to double check, for the second car, be at your address by 5?
additional option: kangamangus highway
fyi weather report looks chilly
that being said if anyone wants to do cog we probably have to book soon
we can also split up saturday if someone people want to do one thing
plan is good

there is also the cog railway which is amazing and super cool but around $80 pp so i don't think that is on the docket
for saturday there are some cool ticketed things we can do such as the flume gorge and the canon mountain tramway
3:15: i pick up miles and isabella. we leave gear at 188 cliff
4:00: me and miles and isabella meet teddy in Jericho
5:00: abijah picks up max from 188 cliff and loads car up with luggage and coolers left at apartment 
5:30: paul  leaves with remaining folks
6:00: first car arrives in NH at campground & set up tents
others arrive throughout night. <@416998580071563264> I likely need make model and license plate of your car (you can dm me obv if you prefer)
SATURDAY
9:00 am- wake up (idc if its a bit later but this I will be shcoked if we sleep later)
11:00 leave for day to go out
rest of day: hiking and chilling and whatever (we can discuss details later but there are some cool options) 
SUNDAY
leave by 11 am

 - 2
-does anyone not like burgers
-cheese, ketchup, mustard, anything else needed? Pickles?

Like what small animal is the size of the pasta you eat
Yeah like rough amount
No but I can bring tea, 2, I like burgers, ketchup, I like pasta a bowl?
yeah
Would anyone be free this week after 5 to grocery shop?
If I had to guess alcohol is also not allowed
I think it would probably be fine edibles but up to you guys
I just don‚Äôt have any
Oh I did@y think of that
oh right we're gonna be in NH so they'll kill us if we have it
Pot as in a metal pot not weed

Super convenient
Just water
Perfect
Oh so no milk or anything?

no
Is anyone morally opposed to paper plates
<@618173952904134676> what does the mac and cheese need

-how many burgers do you eat 1-2
-does anyone not like burgers, i like them
-cheese, ketchup, mustard, anything else needed? Pickles? onions
-how much pasta do you eat? 1/2 box - box depending
Yes
We have a camping stove right?
Oh perfect we could do that for dinner instead of plain pasta? Is anyone besides abjiah lactose intolerant
I also just bought cracker barrel white cheddar macaroni that has to be boiled that I can bring along. I have about five boxes so that could feed everyone for one meal
at least yeah
How many boxes for 8 people? 4 maybe?
-Yes
-Yes (I have two in case anyone needs an extra)
-2
-I eat them
-cheese, ketchup, pickles
-a decent helping I guess
Unless we want to buy lunch out
Also please breakfast and lunch suggestions
Okay I need @everyone to answer the following questions:
-do you drink coffee?
-would you be able to bring a mug for yourself if you do?
-how many burgers do you eat
-does anyone not like burgers
-cheese, ketchup, mustard, anything else needed? Pickles? 
-how much pasta do you eat?

I‚Äôll be sending out a shopping list later and you all can add to it as needed. And tell me if you bought anything
Okay so plan: 
Car 1: me, miles, Isabella, Teddy (3:30).

2:15
@everyone PLEASE REPLY what times are people free Friday? I know Brandon
Do we want to plan out boys weekend activities or should we just play things by ear
lets goooo
there goes any stress i got
Unless abjiah drives 2 mph
sweet
Oh 100%
oh cool so we will def be back before like 6:30?
Check out is 11 so probably early afternoon? I‚Äôll probably make Paul stop for lunch so anywhere between 1-4
what time will we be back sunday?
lol
also the instructor always told us that 'you know you need to switch gears when it shakes a bit'
i can, just havent practiced in a hot minute
the reason i was asking is if there were an emergency of some kind we would essentially be trapped since only you and paul can comfprtably drive stick
I‚Äôll go wherever
the one im taking is not
no
also <@416998580071563264> is your car stick?
i think pauls car will be me, teddy, him, and one other person. who wants to be the 4th in that car and who wants to go with abjiah
ah
i didnt know until recently
oh ok
pauls mom is visiting this weekend so brunch should be okay but i will have to let you know
maybe at brunch?
and id like to get $ by the beginning of next week
since boys weekend is the weekend after this one, should we find a time to talk about ir or are we all good
Since it‚Äôs only 2 weeks out feel free to send me the $ when you get a chance and message me if there‚Äôs any issue
Van Walsen
i dont remember your last name but i can add you now
Thanks
you can also add the friends calander that has everything on it
16, 17, 18
So I can add it to my schedule, what days are we gone?
I mean it‚Äôs the middle of nowhere but you can drive 20 minutes and be in a town
oh is it close to those kinds of things?
If we can get a fire going we can make pasta. We could also just get. A pizza if stuff doesn‚Äôt work out
We can borrow it probably but last time I used it I sprayed gas all over brandon so idk
yeah
i though you were using your dad's
I know we‚Äôve had this conversation before but you‚Äôre eating oatmeal packets not raw oats right
We shouldn‚Äôt tho
we can eat oatmeal raw
Usually I do pasta one night and hot dogs/burgers the other but we won‚Äôt have a gas stove
If you‚Äôre driving you can stop on the way it doesn‚Äôt matter to me
Idk I hadn‚Äôt thought about it
Bc I can drive and get food
/are we getting it on the way
What food do you guys want
i will if she cant get it
cant you call
mom is trying get the dmv to send the stickers here but she is not on the title so im not sure they will let her
are you able to contact dmv or the new residents
uh oh
my parents move and the letter went to the old house
how did that happen
uh oh
well my tags just expired to <@416998580071563264> has to drive
thanks but today is the last day, and then im supposed to mask for another 5 days but idk how that is going to work in the dinning hall
Every other day unless I‚Äôm working
I don‚Äôt lol
i promise lol
i shower more than 3 times a week
We can drop off snacks later or something
I‚Äôm sorry
ive been stuck in my room for like 5 days
stinky
ok gamer
its just to give me an idea of time
scheduled showers
sounds good
I'm good with 30 as well (I don't have a car)
looks like paul has cor until 5:15.
the only thing that matters is grey and green
can you also tell me your friday schedules when you get a chance
i'm cool w 30
just lmk
can always change it
i guess put me for 30
@here tell me if you plan to buy food and i can adjust numbers
its 30 standard, 20 if you buy food, 10 if youre driving and buy food
i think we are taking <@416998580071563264> 's car so i think i either pay like 20 or 10 if i decide to buy food
did we decide who is driving between miles and abjiah or both?
pls reach out if this doesnt seem right but this is my most up to date cost table for boys weekend
I mean we could take three cars if we want more space j suppose
mine with people doesn't have a lot of storage space
<@408779745136738324>
<@416404018634686465>
And if we really need it someone else will license can drive one of my other cars as well
We got big car I should be able to see five including me and carry up pretty large chunk of equipment in the back of it it's a big SUV so
<@416998580071563264> how many can you seat? i can take 4 not including me
You or abjiah whoever prefers
i come, we use my car right?
I come
I take cash check Venmo PayPal.     I don‚Äôt take card yet but I will soon.
If you don‚Äôt have that much $ just let me know we‚Äôll work it out that‚Äôs not going to be the reason someone can‚Äôt come
We can discuss if y‚Äôall don‚Äôt think that is fair
My ideal would be $30 ($10 campsite, $10 gas, $10 food) 20 if you are bring food instead. And 10 if you‚Äôre the one driving and bring food
What is payment
I will come
<@301516213773795328> you said no right
I‚Äôm in the same room as Dillon he‚Äôs intentionally not included
<@416404018634686465> <@293489371309670410> <@416998580071563264> <@502272136585412619> <@293489371309670410> <@425781751516889118>
People
Do we have 10 or less?
I would like to collect payment for boys weekend soon
He wasn‚Äôt he just asked to go last night
I didn't even know he was invited
Please no
Completely respectfully I‚Äôm not sure I want George to come to boys weekend. Thoughts?
Okay I thought so
I should be
<@416998580071563264> are you coming to boys weekend
We‚Äôll be back for dinner at the latest that Sunday so you could do duty that night if needed
Yes
It's still September 16-18 right?
Devastating news
NOOO
I don't think I'm coming to boys weekend unfortunately otherwise I'd be contributing more lol
Hey as y‚Äôall are creating duty schedules make sure you‚Äôre not on during boys weekend <@416404018634686465> <@618173952904134676> <@293489371309670410> <@246405757908549633> <@301516213773795328>

<@502272136585412619> do you have a tent?
Can we do a tent inventory pls. Say if you have a tent and how many people fit
i think food we will figure out closer to leaving, but tents and coolers and stuff like that are mostly accounted for as far as i am aware
everyone will need the stuf they need to sleep (probably sleeping bag, mat, and pillow) i have a few extras of various things if its a problem
Do we have a packing list of what everyone is bringing/should bring?
Ah ok
Usually you have to buy pre cut firewood at state parks
I don‚Äôt think so
Will we need an axe?
Cool üëç
<@502272136585412619> this is the camping channel
no idea yet
uhh i dont think more tents would hurt. how big?
for some reason i read that as tetanus in the pop up
do we need more tent?
i might have tent
It‚Äôs gorgeous
Idk if you‚Äôve been to the area before but there‚Äôs tons of mini hikes we‚Äôll do
They have a rescue team specifically for mount washington tourists lol
Henry and I climbed bald mountain a few years ago that wasn‚Äôt bad
Oh I didn't know it was the tallest lmao let's do a shorter one
The hike is possible but I‚Äôd rather do a shorter hike since it‚Äôs the tallest mountain in New England and I haven‚Äôt trained for it
Like that would be a whole day thing for the train
its a hike XD
Would we be able to get to the top by hiking?
ive driven along it through there before
its pretty long tho i think
i guess
yeah
Yeah that‚Äôs why I said we‚Äôd have to talk about it because it‚Äôs cool af but super pricy
D:
per person?
86 :/
trains are bussin
How much per person?
It‚Äôs kind of expensive so we can discuss it more
Bro thats cool
Ok cool, I guess so
Top of mount Washington
What does it take us too
do we want to do the cog railway
really? cause thats what paul an i were planning
I've modified one of these to use a 30lb cansiter XD
Stonks
Stinks
we can still go to the harvest festival\

thank god miles made us move the weekend of boys weekend
okay so i have some good news
your mom gave me head
I have camp stoved before, but there is nothing like a oven shelf rack on a camp fire
We can just do fire pit too
Just gotta make sure you get enough of those tiny canisters
Does that use propane gas? I'm pretty sure those aren't too bad to use
this is the one i am considering
... do I want to know
We failed to light a charcoal grill twice
god i miss jerome
yeeah i was about to mention the incident
honestly i might just buy a portable grill
Also, we've already learned that we aren't capable of using coal
he has like four of this exact stove
yeah but you have to pump it to get the fuel going and light it by hand
Is you camp stove not just a burner with a propane tank, knob, and starter?
Get me some coals and a metal grate and I‚Äôve got you covered
did he deserve it? maybe
i thought so too but the one i tried to use you had to pump to create pressure and it almost exploded and sprayed gas all over brandon
I'm pretty sure I can use a camp stove
Oooh. I should have drawn that connection
her partner
Who's kyla
oh my god
Not bc the steaks but because my dear Kyla was panicking about the fire alarm and came to help me clear the smoke and left the oven mit on the stove
Kyla and I almost just burned down the apartment making steaks
reservation made
hot dog on stick
true
Can't we just make a fire and use frying pan
im worried about the camping stove
Its been a bit but I can still use a shotgun well if we have one
NH crack heads
What are you worried about?
it is just black bears that doesnt worry me much
0h right there are bears
he is but he def knows how to camp
You dad is scary from what I have heard
do we invite my dad
okay here's the big question though
Mmm I will b
@everyone head count
should i put 12 or 16?
can i get a head count really quick for the trip?
does anyone know how to use a camping stove? not that we need it but i almost killed brandon and teddy with it in the fall of 2020
A05 and A06
\
so i think i will go with these
turns out you cant reserve those online
Why wouldn't we?
they seem prettier tho
we dont want a walk up site right
Good bc I do not have a tent
It sounds like between me and abijah we have enough if he comes
Here's hoping I actually remember to bring my sleeping bag and stuff to school because I won't have a chance to go back and get anything.  I know I have a one person tent, but I might have a 2 person and a 4 person floating around somewhere in the crawlspace under my house
XD
Oops
yes in every state
üò≥
You need a license?
Been a while since I've done that
Oh man I could renew my fishing license
but i hope you guys have a lot of fun
i don't know that I would be able to go all the way to New HampshireüòÖ that's an expensive plane ticket for a weekend trip
im booking the campsite soon, but trying to figure out the cancellation policy because my dad mentioned these cabins owned by one of the colleges over there but it wouldn't open to rent until july 25
It's honestly a true four person tent you could fit 8 but it would be a can of sardines
Idk what else I got to offer tho
dang
Utah Cali, the long trial you name it
Its pretty compact to but it's been everywhere
Ight, I got an 8 person of anyone wanna share
And 1 small cooler and 1 big booler
I am also bring 4 man tent
Soo this may be a good offer
I already got a tent and stuff
Mmm tempting that is
everyone is invitesd
Hell yeah
Yooo
we're going to franconia notch, nh
Where ya going?
Ah
haha we barely talked about it
Lol I never knew this was a thing
for our camping trip in the fall
What is this chat?
wed have to buy passes for nh so probably not but its an option
Do we want a fishing pole
My hand writing is ass
I made old bay scrabled eggs yesterday
You know it
Packing list: old bay
Making packing list for when I return to vt
I think there‚Äôs a lake or river at the camp ground
Probably can be but not required
Will we be swimming at all?
Bc I was going to riot fest but am now going to firefly bc flights are unpredictable
Why change
New boys weekend dates September 16th-18th
huh
@here for the boys
nvm, <@416998580071563264> i figured out sys320
<@303228816631791627> <@416998580071563264> each timeline.body entry is supposed to be a new line right? or one line
more illegal to use neigbors bins
Okay follow up: is it more illegal to use the neighbors bins, or to not compost at all (both are illegal)
Is it illegal to put compost in the neighbors bin

wrong chat lmao
wha
Wewa
hey <@408779745136738324> whats the plan for the harvest fest?
Do we know when max and Abijah and Dillon are
That is correct
Mans in question
ah

No another fish will
? you're going to eat them?
Noon
Although to be perfectly honest these guys will likely end their life as food so
Yeah that‚Äôs fair
Idk who the other guy is
keep an eye on him and see if he seems to be in distress/suffering/a threat to other fish. if it seems so then i would say its okay
Ask Brandon what time he‚Äôs done Friday
Yeah
New idx plates??

He‚Äôs like swimming in circles so idk if that‚Äôs suffering but he isn‚Äôt healthy for sure
I thought you were on the phone with him
depends. is the fish in distress or suffering
Oh
We were talking about GMOs earlier that‚Äôs probably why
I'm not with Paul üëÄ
I didn‚Äôt but I‚Äôm not surprised Paul does frequently
How did you know we were talking about eugenics
Can I euthanize Paul‚Äôs disabled incest fish that was just born
Is eugenics okay if it‚Äôs fish
Video too big
Damn
<@303228816631791627>

My great great grandfather was like nah fam and ditched Germany, and changed our last name at a sus time in history
I have some ww2 ‚Äútrophies‚Äù from my great uncle that my family doesn‚Äôt know what to do with :/
They were nazis lol
Lmao they be like nope, we out
uh my German great grandparents moved to the south of Brazil at a sus time in history.
So I don't think it's a war crime but when my great grandfather was leaving Germany (I think it was germany) when wwii was over he found a bunch of German guns ditched behind a dumpster so he brought them back
One of the night auditors at Trapps got repremanded for that
Imagine

Huh
But anyway yeah like I guess that‚Äôs pretty fucked ip thing I learned about today
Sorry I said horrific
Lol
I wasn‚Äôt trying to be nonchalant about it lol
I did say disgusting war crimes
Oh
Okay so someone who works at a pawn shop and someone brought in their grandpas ‚Äútrophy‚Äù book from WW2 stationed in Japan and there‚Äôs so many photographs in it that are proving this event that the Japanese say doesn‚Äôt exist
I saw war crimes in the notifications and had to jump on it
That was fast

because of porn
That's weird
i bet it has to do with that
idk and it's only the raw subdomain
Also when are you done that, and are you going to be in today?
That's like a learning tool

I haven't figured out ad01 yet but im working on it. i have work starting at 2 and i need one of you to keep going until i go remote for the night

Yeah np. It looks good

thank you!
he hasnt read it but im trying to get him too
Especially if sandman is a book Scudder likes
But besides those teeny things content wise üëå
Also the United States of America would be more accurate since America also means central, north and south and I assume you just mean USA.
I would end the first sentence after (Irwin 4). Delete the ‚Äúand‚Äù and start the next sentence with ‚Äúas I have.‚Äù Also you use Irwin‚Äôs last name but continue to use  ibns first and last names
yes
Do you want grammar suggestion

6 February 2022

In Ibn Khaldun by Robert Irwin, there is a section where Irwin writes about how Ibn Khaldun would study the ruins from past dynasties (Irwin 4) and as I‚Äôve been reading the graphic novel The Sandman: Fables & Reflection I‚Äôve been thinking about the role of ‚Äòdreams‚Äô in culture. A dream (or in other words an ideal or goal) can tell you a lot about a person, and I am starting to think that that extends to groups of people as well. For example, when America was being created, the dream they were striving for was the ability to control their own paths, and this shared dream is what brought that group of people and gave them something to drive for. This idea of a shared goaled or struggle is something that we have talked about in class, and if I remember correctly most of us concluded that it was necessary in order to bring people together. 
If stories of triumph were created to represent our dreams, then maybe al-Mas‚Äòudi including stories that cannot be true, were not meant to be seen as fact but rather were meant to capture the dreams of the civilization of study.

For about a year I have been reading The Sandman series by Neil Gaiman. The series focuses on Morpheus, one of the Endless (think of them as gods), and he is the ruler of dreams and the dream world. I am currently in book six, and while reading recently I‚Äôve been thinking about how the ‚Äòdreams‚Äô of past civilizations tell us a lot about them. For example, when America was being created, the dream they were striving for was the ability to control their own paths. 

    On another note at Champlain, we talk a lot about information literacy, and I think that these rules can be applied to other topics, not just history. For example, a post about some new pill that makes you lose a crazy ton of weight would break some of one of these rules. Or a study that states that vaccines cause Autism in 20 of 50 children (this is an exaggeration of an exaggeration) obviously breaks ‚Äòis it in the bonds of the ordinary.‚Äô

that you can manage
that's okay because it has a web client
he said it didn't matter
you can monitor windows but you cant manage from  windows
he wants it to be on something like centos
you can
so it can't monitor any windows devices?
if not im getting the manjaro laptop out
yeah does it not have windows support?
docker is pretty easy to use
idk if im just crazy tho
yeah the docker download is to an app called docker which isnt 100% theirs?
